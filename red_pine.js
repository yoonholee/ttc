    "Bestowing no honours keeps people from fighting\nprizing no treasures keeps people from stealing\ndisplaying no attractions keeps people from making trouble\nthus the rule of the sage empties the mind but fills the stomach weakens the will but strengthens the bones\nby keeping the people from knowing or wanting and those who know from daring to act\nhe thus governs them all",
    "The Tao is so empty those who use it never become full again\nand so deep as if it were the ancestor of us all\ndulling our edges untying our tangles softening our light merging our dust\nand so clear as if it were present\nI wonder whose child it is it seems it was here before the Ti",
    "Heaven and Earth are heartless treating creatures like straw dogs\nheartless is the sage treating people like straw dogs\nbetween Heaven and Earth how like a bellows empty but inexhaustible each movement produces more\ntaking only wastes it better to keep it inside",
    "The valley spirit that doesn't die we call the dark womb\nas real as gossamer silk and yet we can't exhaust it.\nThe valley spirit that doesn't die we call the dark womb the dark womb's mouth we call the source of creation as real as gossamer silk and yet we can't exhaust it.",
    "Heaven is eternal and Earth is immortal\nthe reason they're eternal and immortal is because they don't live for themselves hence they can live forever\nthus the sage pulls himself back but ends up in front\nhe lets himself go but ends up safe\nselflessness must be the reason whatever he seeks he finds",
    "The best are like water bringing help to all without competing choosing what others avoid hence approaching the Tao\ndwelling with earth thinking with depth helping with kindness speaking with truth\ngoverning with peace working with skill moving with time\nand because they don't compete they aren't maligned",

    "Thirty spokes converge on a hub but it's the emptiness that makes a wheel work\npots are fashioned from clay but it's the hollow that make a pot work\nwindows and doors are carved for a house but it's the spaces that make a house work\nexistence makes something useful but nonexistence makes it work",
    "The five colours make our eyes blind the five tones make our ears deaf the five flavours make our mouths numb\nriding and hunting make our minds wild hard-to-get goods make us break laws\nthus the rule of the sage puts the stomach ahead of the eyes thus he picks this over that",
    "Favour and disgrace are like warnings honour and disaster are like the body\nand why are favour and disgrace like warnings favour means descending to gain it is like a warning to lose it is like a warning thus are favour and disgrace like warnings\nand why are honour and disaster like the body the reason we have disaster is because we have a body if we didn't have a body we wouldn't have disaster\nwho honours is body as much as the world can be entrusted with the world who loves his body as much as the world can be encharged with the world",
    "We look but don't see it and call it indistinct we listen but don't hear it and call it faint we reach but don't grasp it and call it ethereal\nthree failed means to knowledge I weave into one\nwith no light above and no shade below too fine to be named returning to nothing\nthis is the formless form the immaterial image this is the waxing waning we meet without seeing its face we follow without seeing its back\nholding onto this very Way we rule this very realm and discover its ancient past this is the thread of the Way",
    "The ancient masters of the Way aimed at the indiscernible and penetrated the dao\nyou would never know them I describe them with reluctance they were careful as if crossing a river in winter cautious as if worried about neighbours reserved like guests\nephemeral like melting ice simple like uncarved wood open like valleys and murky like puddles\nbut a puddle becomes clear when it's still and stillness becomes alive when it's roused\nthose who treasure this Way don't try to be full not trying to be full they can hide and stay hidden",
    "Let limits be empty the center be still\nten thousand things rise we watch them return creatures without number all return to their roots\nreturn to their roots to be still to be still to revive to revive to endure knowing how to endure is wisdom not knowing is to suffer in vain\nknowing how to endure is to be all-embracing all embracing means impartial impartial means the king the king means Heaven Heaven means the Way\nand the Way means long life life without trouble.",

    "When the Great Way disappears we meet kindness and justice\nwhen reason appears we meet great deceit\nwhen the six relations fail we meet obedience and love\nwhen the country is in chaos we meet honest officials",
    "Get rid of wisdom and reason and people will live a hundred times better\nget rid of kindness and justice and people once more will love and obey\nget rid of cleverness and profit and thieves will cease to exist\nbut these three sayings are not enough hence let this be added\nwear the undyed and hold the uncarved reduce self-interest and limit desires get rid of learning and problems will vanish",
    "Yes and no aren't so far apart lovely and ugly aren't so unalike\nwhat others fear we too must fear\nbefore the moon wanes everyone is gay as if they were at the Great Sacrifice or climbing a tower in spring I sit here and make no sign like a child that doesn't smile lost with no one to turn to\nwhile others enjoy more I alone seem forgotten my mind is so foolish so simple\nothers look bright I alone seem dim others are certain I alone am confused receding like the ocean waxing without cease\neveryone has a goal I alone am dumb and backward for I alone choose to differ preferring still my mother's breast",
    "The expression of empty virtue comes from the Tao alone\nthe Tao as a thing waxes and wanes it waxes and wanes but inside is an image it waxes and wanes but inside is a creature it's distant and dark but inside is an essence an essence fundamentally real and inside is a heart\nthroughout the ages its name has never changed so we might follow our fathers\nhow do we know what our fathers were like through this",
    "Partial means whole crooked means straight hollow means full worn-out means new less means content more means confused\nthus the sage holds onto the one to use in guiding the world\nnot watching himself he appears not displaying himself he flourishes not flattering himself he succeeds not parading himself he leads\nbecause he doesn't compete no one can compete against him\nthe ancients who said partial means whole came close indeed becoming whole depends on this",
    "Whispered words are natural a gale doesn't last all morning a squall doesn't last all day\nwho else could make these only Heaven and Earth if Heaven and Earth can't make things last what about Man\nthus in whatever we do let those on the Way be one with the Way let those who succeed be one with success let those who fail be one with failure\nbe one with success for the Way succeeds too be one with failure for the Way fails too",
    "Who tiptoes doesn't stand who strides doesn't walk\nwho watches himself doesn't appear who displays himself doesn't flourish\nwho flatters himself achieves nothing who parades himself doesn't lead\non the road they say too much food and a tiring pace some things are simply bad thus the Taoist avoids them",
    "Imagine a nebulous thing here before Heaven and Earth silent and elusive it stands alone not wavering it travels everywhere unharmed it could be the mother of us all\nnot knowing its name I call it the Tao forced to name it I name it Great\ngreat means ever-flowing ever-flowing means far-reaching far-reaching means returning\nthe Tao is great Heaven is great Earth is great the king is also great the realm contains four greats of these the king is one\nMan imitates Earth Earth imitates Heaven Heaven imitates the Tao the Tao imitates itself",
    "Heavy is the root of light still is the master of busy\nthus a lord might travel all day but never far from his supplies even in a guarded camp his manner is calm and aloof\nwhy would the lord of ten thousand chariots treat himself lighter than his kingdom\ntoo light he loses his base too busy he loses command",
    "Good walking leaves no tracks good talking reveals no flaws good counting counts no beads\ngood closing locks no locks and yet it can't be opened good tying ties no knots and yet it can't be undone\nthus the sage is good at saving and yet abandons no one nor anything of use this is called cloaking the light\nthus the good instruct the bad the bad learn from the good\nnot honouring their teachers not cherishing their students the wise alone are perfectly blind this is called peering into the distance",
    "Recognize the male but hold onto the female and be the world's maid being the world's maid don't lose your ancient virtue not losing your ancient virtue be a newborn child again\nrecognize the pure but hold onto the defiled and be the world's valley being the world's valley be filled with ancient virtue being filled with ancient virtue be uncarved wood again\nrecognize the white but hold onto the black and be the world's guide being the world's guide don't stray from the ancient virtue not straying from ancient virtue be without limits again\nuncarved wood can be split to make tools the sage makes it his chief official a master tailor doesn't cut",
    "Trying to govern the world with force I see this not succeeding\nthe world is a spiritual thing it can't be forced to force it is to harm it to control it is to lose it\nsometimes things lead sometimes they follow sometimes blow hot sometimes blow cold sometimes expand sometimes collapse\ntherefore the sage avoids extremes avoids extravagance avoids excess",
    "Use the Tao to help your king don't use weapons to rule the land such things soon return\nwhere armies camp brambles grow\nbest to win then stop don't make use of force\nwin but don't be proud win but don't be vain win but don't be cruel win when you have no choice this is to win without force\nvirility means old age this isn't the Tao what isn't the Tao ends early",
    "Weapons are not auspicious tools some things are simply bad thus the Taoist shuns them\nin peace the ruler honours the left in war he honours the right\nweapons are not auspicious weapons are not a ruler's tools he wields them when he has no choice dispassion is the best\nthus he does not beautify them he who beautifies them enjoys killing others he who enjoys killing others achieves no worldly rule\nthus we honour the left for joy we honour the right for sorrow the left is where the adjutant stands the commander on the right\nwhich means at a funeral when you kill another honour him with your tears when the battle is won treat it as a wake\nthe first distinction gives us names after we have names we should know restraint who knows restraint knows no trouble",
    "The Tao has never had a name simple and though small no one can command it\nif a lord upheld it the world would be his guest\nwhen Heaven joins with Earth they bestow sweet dew no one gives the order it comes down to all\nto picture the Tao in the world imagine rivers and the sea",
    "Who knows others is perceptive who knows himself is wise\nwho conquers others is forceful who conquers himself is strong\nwho knows contentment is wealthy who strives hard succeeds\nwho doesn't lose his place endures who dies but doesn't perish lives on",
    "The Tao drifts it can go left or right\neverything lives by its grace but it doesn't speak when its work succeeds it makes no claim it has no desires\nshall we call it small\neverything turns to it but it wields no control shall we call it great\ntherefore the sage never acts great thus he can do great things",
    "Hold up the Great Image and the world will come and be beyond harm safe serene and at one\nfine food and song detain passing guests\nwhen the Tao speaks it's senseless and plain we look and don't see it we listen and don't hear it",
    "What you would shorten you should therefore lengthen what you would weaken you should therefore strengthen what you would topple you should therefore raise what you would take you should therefore give\nthis is called hiding the light the weak conquering the strong\nfish can't survive out of the deep as state's greatest tool is not meant to be shown",
    "The Tao never does a thing yet there is nothing it doesn't do\nif a ruler could uphold it people by themselves would change and changing if their desires stirred he would make them still with simplicity that has no name\nstilled by nameless simplicity they would not desire and not desiring be at peace the world would fix itself",
    "Higher Virtue is not virtuous thus it possesses virtue Lower Virtue is not without virtue thus it possesses no virtue\n\nHigher Virtue lacks effort and the thought of effort Higher Kindness involves effort but not the thought of effort Higher Justice involves effort and the thought of effort Higher Ritual involves effort but no response until it threatens and compels\nwhen the Way is lost virtue appears when virtue is lost kindness appears when kindness is lost justice appears when justice is lost ritual appears\nritual marks the waning of belief and onset of confusion augury is the flower of the Way and beginning of delusion\nthus the great choose thick over thin the fruit over the flower therefore they pick this over that",
    "Of things that became one in the past Heaven became one and was clear Earth became one and was still spirits became one and were active\nstreams became one and were full kings became one and ruled the world\nbut by implication Heaven would crack if it were always clear Earth would crumble if it were always still spirits would fail\nif they were always active streams would dry up if they were always full kings would fall if they were always high and noble\nthus the noble is based on the humble the high is founded on the low\nthus do kings refer to themselves as orphaned widowed and destitute but this is the basis of humility\ncounting a carriage as no carriage at all\nnot wanting to clink like jade they clunk like rocks",
    "The Tao moves the other way the Tao works through weakness\nthe things of this world come from something something comes from nothing",
    "When a great person hears of the Way he follows it with devotion when an average person hears of the Way he doesn't know if it's real or not\nwhen a small person hears of the Way he laughs out loud if he didn't laugh it wouldn't be the Way\nhence these sayings arose the brightest path seems dark the quickest path seems slow the smoothest path seems rough the highest virtue low the whitest white pitch-black the greatest virtue wanting\nthe staunchest virtue timid the truest truth uncertain the perfect square lacks corners the perfect tool does nothing the perfect sound is hushed the perfect form is shapeless\nthe Tao is hidden and has no name but because it's the Tao it knows how to start and how to finish",
    "The Tao gives birth to one one gives birth to two two gives birth to three three gives birth to ten thousand things\nten thousand things with yin at their backs and yang in their embrace and breath between for harmony\nwhat the world hates to be orphaned widowed or destitute kings use for their titles\nthus some gain by losing others lose by gaining\nthus what people teach I teach too tyrants never choose their deaths this becomes my teacher",
    "The weakest thing in the world excels the strongest thing in the world what doesn't exist finds room where there is none thus we know doing nothing succeeds\nteaching without words succeeding without effort few in the world can equal this",
    "Which is more vital fame or health which is more precious health or riches which is more harmful loss or gain\nthe deeper the love the higher the cost the bigger the treasure the greater the loss\nwho knows contentment suffers no shame who knows restraint encounters no trouble",

    "When the Tao prevails courier horses manure fields instead of roads when the Tao fails war-horses are raised on the border\nno crime is worse than yielding to desire no wrong is greater than discontent no curse is crueller than getting what you want\nthe contentment of being content is true contentment indeed",
    "Without going out his door he knows the whole world without looking out his window he knows the Way of Heaven the farther people go the less people know\ntherefore the sage knows without moving names without seeing succeeds without trying",

    "The sage has no mind of his own his mind is the mind of the people\nto the good he is good to the bad he is good until they become good\nto the true he is true to the false he is true until they become true\nin the world the sage withdraws with others he merges his mind people open their ears and eyes the sage covers them up",
    "Appearing means life disappearing means death\nthirteen are the followers of life thirteen are the followers of death but people living to live join the land of death's thirteen and why because they live to live\nit's said that those who guard life well aren't injured by soldiers in battle or harmed by rhinos or tigers in the wild\nfor rhinos have nowhere to sink their horns tigers have nowhere to sink their claws and soldiers have nowhere to sink their blades and why because for them there is no land of death",
    "The Way begets them Virtue keeps them matter shapes them usage completes them thus do all things honour the Way and glorify Virtue\nthe honour of the Way the glory of Virtue and not conferred but always so the Way begets and keeps them cultivates and trains them steadies and adjusts them nurtures and protects them\nbut begets without possessing acts without presuming and cultivates without controlling this is called Dark Virtue",
    "The world has a maiden she becomes the world's mother\nwho knows the mother understands the child who understands the child keeps the mother safe and lives without trouble\nwho blocks the opening who closes the gate lives without toil\nwho unblocks the opening who meddles in affairs lives without hope\nwho sees the small has vision who protects the weak has strength\nwho uses his light who trusts his vision lives beyond death this is the Hidden Immortal",
    "Were I sufficiently wise I would follow the Great Way and only fear going astray\nthe Great Way is smooth but people love byways\ntheir palaces are spotless their fields are overgrown and their granaries are empty\nthey wear fine clothes they carry sharp swords they tire of food and drink and possess more than they need this is called robbery and robbery is not the Way",
    "What is planted right is not uprooted what is held right is not ripped away future generations worship it forever\ncultivated in thee self virtue becomes real cultivated in the family virtue multiplies cultivated in the village virtue increases cultivated in the state virtue prospers cultivated in the world virtue abounds\nthus view the self through the self view the family through the family view the village through the village view the state through the state view the world through the world\nhow do we know what the world is like through this",
    "He who contains virtue in abundance resembles a newborn child wasps don't sting him beasts don't claw him birds of prey don't carry him off his bones are weak and his tendons are soft and yet his grip is firm\nhe hasn't known the union of sexes and yet his penis is stiff so full of essence is he\nhe cries all day yet ever gets hoarse so full of breath is he who knows how to breath endures who knows how to endure is wise\nwho lengthens his life tempts luck who breathes with his will is strong\nbut virility means old age this isn't the Way what isn't the Way ends early",

    "Use direction to govern a country use indirection to fight a war use inaction to rule the world how do we know this works\nthe greater the prohibitions the poorer the people the sharper the weapons the darker the realm\nthe smarter the scheme the stranger the outcome the finer the treasure the thicker the thieves\nthus the sage declares I change nothing and the people transform themselves I stay still and the people adjust themselves\nI do nothing and the people enrich themselves I want nothing and the people simplify themselves",
    "Where government stands aloof the people open up where government steps in the people slip away\nhappiness rests in misery misery hides in happiness\nwho knows where they end there is no direction direction turns into indirection good turns into evil the people have been lost for a long long time\nthus the sage is an edge that doesn't cut a point that doesn't pierce a line that doesn't extend a light that doesn't blind",
    "In governing people and caring for Heaven nothing surpasses economy\neconomy means planning ahead planning ahead means accumulating virtue accumulating virtue means overcoming all overcoming all means knowing no limit knowing no limit means guarding the realm\nguarding the realm's mother means living long\nthis means deep roots and a solid trunk the Way of long and lasting life",
    "Ruling a great state is like cooking a small fish\nwhen you govern the world with the Tao spirits display no powers\nNot that they don't have power, But their power will not harm people.\nInasmuch as none of them harms anybody, Therefore virtue belongs to them both.",
    "The great state is a watershed the confluence of the world the female of the world through stillness the female conquers the male in order to be still she needs to be lower\nthe great state that is lower governs the small state the small state that is lower is governed by the great state\nsome lower themselves to govern some lower themselves to be governed\nthe great state's only desire is to unite and lead others the small state's only desire is to join and serve others\nfor both to achieve their desire the greater needs to be lower",
    "The Tao is creation's sanctuary treasured by the good it keeps the bad alive\nbeautiful words might be the price noble deeds might be the gift how can we abandon people who are bad\nthus when emperors are enthroned or ministers installed though there be great discs of jade followed by teams of horses they don't rival one who sits and offers up this Way\nwhy the ancients exalted it did they not proclaim who searches thereby finds who errs thereby escapes thus the world exalts it",
    "Act without acting work without working taste without tasting\ngreat or small many or few repay each wrong with virtue\nplan for the hard while it's easy work on the great while it's small\nthe hardest task in the world begins easy the greatest goal in the world begins small\ntherefore the sage never acts great he thus achieves great things\nwho quickly agrees is seldom trusted who makes it all easy finds it all hard\ntherefore the sage makes everything hard he thus finds nothing hard",
    "It's easy to rule while it's peaceful it's east to plan before it arrive it's easy to break while it's fragile it's easy to disperse while it's small\nact before it exists govern before it rebels\nas giant tree grows from the tiniest shoot a great tower rises from a basket of dirt a thousand mile journey begins at your feet\nbut to act is to fail to control is to lose therefore the sage doesn't act he thus doesn't fail he doesn't control he thus doesn't lose\nwhen people pursue a task they always fail near the end care at the end as well as the start means an end to failure\nthe sage thus seeks what no one seeks he doesn't prize hard to-get-goods he studies what no one studies he turns to what others pass by to help all things be natural he thus dares not act",
    "The ancient masters of the Way tried not to enlighten but to keep men in the dark\nwhat makes the people hard to rule is knowledge who rules the realm with knowledge spreads evil in the realm who rules without knowledge spreads virtue in the realm\nwho understands these two understands the universal key this is called Dark Virtue\nDark Virtue goes deep goes far goes the other way until it reaches perfect harmony",
    "The reason the sea can govern a hundred rivers is because it has mastered being lower thus it can govern a hundred rivers\nthus if the sage would be above the people he should speak as if he were below them if he would be before them he should act as though he were behind them\nthus when the sage is above the people are not burdened when he is in front the people are not hindered the world never wearies of pushing him forward\nbecause he doesn't struggle no one can struggle against him",
    "The world calls me great great but useless because I am great I am useless if I were of use I would have stayed small\nbut I possess three treasures I treasure and uphold first is compassion second is austerity third is reluctance to excel\nbecause I am compassionate I can be valiant because I am austere I can be extravagant because I am reluctant to excel I can be chief of all tools\nif I renounced compassion for valour austerity for extravagance reluctance for supremacy I would die\ncompassion wins every battle and outlasts every attack what Heaven creates let compassion protect",
    "In ancient times the perfect officer wasn't armed the perfect warrior wasn't angry\nthe perfect victor wasn't hostile the perfect commander acted humble\nthis is the virtue of nonaggression this is using the strength of others this is uniting with Heaven which was the ancient end",
    "In warfare there is a saying rather than a host better to be a guest rather than advance an inch better to retreat a foot\nthis means to form no column to wear no armour to brandish no weapon to repulse no enemy\nno fate is worse than to have no enemy without an enemy we would lose our treasure\nthus when opponents are evenly matched the remorseful one prevails",
    "My words are easy to understand easy to employ but no one can understand them no one can employ them\nwords have an ancestor deeds have a master because they have no understanding people fail to understand me rare are they who understand me thus I am exalted\nthe sage therefore wears coarse cloth and keeps his jade inside",
    "To understand yet not understand is transcendence not to understand yet understand is affliction\nthe reason the sage is not afflicted is because he treats affliction as affliction hence he is not afflicted",
    "When people no longer fear authority a greater authority will appear\ndon't restrict where people dwell don't repress how people live if they aren't repressed they won't protest\nthus the sage knows himself but doesn't reveal himself he loves himself but doesn't exalt himself thus he picks this over that",
    "Daring to act means death daring not to act means life\nof these two one benefits one harms what Heaven hates who knows the reasons\nthe Way of Heaven wins easily without a fight answers wisely without a word comes quickly without a summons plans ingeniously without a thought\nthe Net of Heaven is all-embracing it mesh is wide but nothing escapes",
    "If people no longer fear death why do we threaten to kill them\nand if others fear death and still act perverse and we catch and kill them who else will dare\nas long as people fear death the executioner will exist to kill in the executioner's place is to take the carpenter's place who takes the carpenter's place is bound to hurt his hands",
    "The reason the people are hungry is because those above levy so many taxes thus the people are hungry\nthe reason the people are hard to rule is because those above are so forceful thus the people are hard to rule\nthe reason people think little of death is because those above think so much of life thus the people think little of death meanwhile those who do nothing to live are more esteemed than those who love life",
    "When people are born they are soft and supple when they perish they are hard and stiff\nwhen plants shoot forth they are soft and tender when they die they are withered and dry\nthus it is said the hard and strong are followers of death the soft and weak are followers of life\nwhen an army becomes strong it suffers defeat when a plant becomes hard it snaps\nthe hard and strong dwell below the soft and weak dwell above",
    "The Way of Heaven is like stringing a bow pulling sown the high lifting up the low shortening the long lengthening the short\nthe Way of Heaven takes from the long and supplements the short unlike the Way of Man taking from the short and giving to the long\nwho can find the long and give it to the world only those who find the Way\nthus the sage does not presume on what he does or claim what he achieves thus he chooses to hide his skill",
    "Nothing in the world is weaker than water but against the hard and the strong nothing excels it for nothing can change it\nthe soft overcomes the hard the weak overcomes the strong this is something everyone knows but no one is able to practice\nthus the sage declares who accepts a country's disgrace we call the lord of soil and grain who accepts a country's misfortune we call king of all under Heaven upright words sound upside down",
    "In resolving a great dispute a dispute is sure to remain how can this be good\nthus the sage holds the left marker he makes no claim on others\nthus the virtuous oversee markers the virtueless oversee taxes\nthe Way of Heaven favours no one but always helps the good",
    "Imagine a small state with a small population let there be labour-saving tools that aren't used let people consider death and not move far\nlet there be boats and carts but no reason to ride them let there be armour and weapons but no reason to employ them\nlet people return to the use of knots and be satisfied with their food and pleased with their clothing and content with their homes and happy with their customs\nlet there be a state so near people hear its dogs and chickens and live out their lives without making a visit",
    "True words aren't beautiful beautiful words aren't true\nthe good aren't eloquent the eloquent aren't good\nthe wise aren't learned the learned aren't wise\nthe sage accumulates nothing but the more he does for others the greater his existence the more he gives to others the greater his abundance\nthe Way of Heaven is to help without harming the Way of the sage is to act without struggling"
