There's a source all beneath heaven shares: call it the mother of all beneath heaven.
Once you fathom the mother you understand the child, and once you understand the child you abide in the mother,
self gone, free of danger.
If you block the senses and close the mind, you never struggle.
If you open the senses and expand your endeavors, nothing can save you.
Seeing the small is called enlightenment, and abiding in the gentle strength.
Wielding radiance return to enlightenment, then you're beyond all harm.
This is the cultivation of constancy.
