High Integrity never has Integrity and so is indeed Integrity.
Low Integrity never loses Integrity and so is not at all Integrity.
High Integrity does nothing
and has no motives.
Low Integrity does something
and has sure motives.
High Humanity does something
and has no motives.
High Duty does something
and has sure motives.
High Ritual does something,
and when no one follows along
it rolls up its sleeves
and forces them into line.
Lose Way, and Integrity appears.
Lose Integrity, and Humanity appears.
Lose Humanity, and Duty appears.
Lose Duty, and Ritual appears.
Ritual is the thinning away of loyalty and sincerity, the beginning of chaos,
and prophecy is the flowery semblance of Way, the beginning of folly.
This is why a great elder
inhabits thick rather than thin,
fruitful substance rather than flowery semblance,
always ignores that and chooses this.
