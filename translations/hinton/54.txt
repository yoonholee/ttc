Something planted so deep it's never rooted up,
something held so tight it's never stolen away:
children and grandchildren will pay it homage always.
Cultivated in yourself it makes Integrity real.
Cultivated in your family it makes Integrity plentiful.
Cultivated in your village it makes Integrity enduring.
Cultivated in your nation it makes Integrity abundant.
Cultivated in all beneath heaven it makes Integrity all-encompassing.
So look through self into self,
through family into family,
through village into village,
through nation into nation,
through all beneath heaven into all beneath heaven.
How can I know all beneath heaven as it is?
Through this.
