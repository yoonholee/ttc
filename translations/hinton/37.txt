Way is perennially doing nothing so there's nothing it doesn't do.
When lords and emperors abide by this
the ten thousand things follow change of themselves.
Desire drives change,
but I've stilled it with uncarved nameless simplicity.
Uncarved nameless simplicity
is the perfect absence of desire,
and the absence of desire means repose:
all beneath heaven at rest of itself.
