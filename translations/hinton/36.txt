To gather
you must scatter.
To weaken
you must strengthen.
To abandon
you must foster.
To take
you must give.
This is called dusky enlightenment.
Soft and weak overcome hard and strong.
Fish should be kept in their watery depths:
a nation's honed instruments of power should be kept well-hidden from the people.
