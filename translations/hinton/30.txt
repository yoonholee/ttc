If you use the Way to help a ruler of people
you never use weapons to coerce all beneath heaven.
Such things always turn against you:
fields where soldiers camp turn to thorn and bramble, and vast armies on the march leave years of misery behind.
The noble prevail if they must, then stop: they never press on to coerce the world.
Prevail, but never presume.
Prevail, but never boast.
Prevail, but never exult.
Prevail, but never when there's another way.
This is to prevail without coercing.
Things grown strong soon grow old.
This is called losing the Way: Lose the Way and you die young.
