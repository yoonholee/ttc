Ancients who realized primal unity:
Heaven realized primal unity
and so came to clarity.
Earth realized primal unity
and so came to tranquility.
Gods realized primal unity
and so came to spirit.
Valleys realized primal unity
and so came to fullness.
The ten thousand things realized primal unity
and so came to life.
Lords and emperors realized primal unity
and so came to rectify all beneath heaven.
It's their very existence:
without clarity heaven cracks open,
without tranquility earth bursts forth,
without spirit gods cease,
without fullness valleys run dry,
without life the ten thousand things perish,
without high nobility lords and emperors stumble and fall.
Nobility is rooted in humility,
and high founded on low.
This is why true lords and emperors call themselves
orphaned, destitute, ill-fated.
Isn't this rooted in humility?
Isn't it counting the world's praise as no praise,
refusing to tinkle like delicate jade bells or clatter like ponderous stone chimes?
