Honor is a contagion deep as fear, renown a calamity profound as self.
Why do I call honor a contagion deep as fear?
Honor always dwindles away, so earning it fills us with fear and losing it fills us with fear.
And why do I call renown a calamity profound as self?
We only know calamity because we have these selves.
If we didn't have selves what calamity could touch us?
When all beneath heaven is your self in renown you trust yourself to all beneath heaven,
and when all beneath heaven is your self in love you dwell throughout all beneath heaven.
