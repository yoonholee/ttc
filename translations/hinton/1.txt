A Way become Way isn't the perennial Way.
A name become name isn't the perennial name:
the named is mother to the ten thousand things,
but the unnamed is origin to all heaven and earth.
In perennial nonbeing you see mystery, and in perennial being you see appearance.
Though the two are one and the same, once they arise, they differ in name.
One and the same they're called dark-enigma,
dark-enigma deep within dark-enigma,
gateway of all mystery.
