Stretch onto tiptoes and you never stand firm.
Hurry long strides and you never travel far.
Keep up self-reflection
and you'll never be enlightened.
Keep up self-definition
and you'll never be apparent.
Keep up self-promotion
and you'll never be proverbial.
Keep up self-esteem
and you'll never be perennial.
Travelers of the Way call such striving too much food and useless baggage.
Things may not all despise such striving, but a master of the Way stays clear of it.
