The Way of heaven is like a drawn bow pulling down the high and raising up the low:
it takes away where there's abundance and restores where there's want.
The Way of heaven takes away where there's abundance
and restores where there's want,
but the Way of humankind isn't like that:
it takes away where there's want
and gives where there's abundance.
Only a master of the Way can give abundance to all beneath heaven.
Such a sage acts without presumption and never dwells on success:
great worth has no need to be seen.
