The people are starving,
and it's only because you leaders feast on taxes
that they're starving.
The people are impossible to rule,
and it's only because you leaders are masters of extenuation
that they're impossible to rule.
The people take death lightly,
and it's only because you leaders crave life's lavish pleasures
that they take death lightly,
they who act without concern for life: it's a wisdom far beyond treasuring life.
