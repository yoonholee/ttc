You may govern the nation through principle
and lead armies to victory through craft,
but you win all beneath heaven through indifference.
How can I know this to be so?
Through this.
The more prohibitions rule all beneath heaven the deeper poverty grows among the people.
The more shrewd leaders there are the faster dark confusion fills the nation.
The more cleverness people learn the faster strange things happen.
The faster laws and decrees are issued the more bandits and thieves appear.
Therefore a sage says:
I do nothing
and the people transform themselves.
I cherish tranquility
and the people rectify themselves.
I cultivate indifference
and the people enrich themselves.
I desire nothing
and the people return of themselves to uncarved simplicity.
