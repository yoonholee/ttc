Way gives birth to them and Integrity nurtures them.
Matter shapes them and conditions complete them.
That's why the ten thousand things always honor Way and treasure Integrity.
Honoring Way and treasuring Integrity
isn't obedience to command,
it's occurrence perennially appearing of itself.
Way gives birth to them and Integrity nurtures them:
it fosters and sustains them, harbors and succors them, nourishes and shelters them.
Giving birth without possessing,
animating without subjecting,
fostering without dominating:
this is called dark-enigma Integrity.
