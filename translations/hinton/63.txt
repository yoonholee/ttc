If you're nothing doing what you do,
you act without acting and savor without savoring,
you render the small vast and the few many,
use Integrity to repay hatred,
see the complexity in simplicity,
find the vast in the minute.
The complex affairs of all beneath heaven are there in simplicity,
and the vast affairs of all beneath heaven are there in the minute.
That's why a sage never bothers with vastness and so becomes utterly vast.
Easy promises breed little trust, and too much simplicity breeds too much complexity.
That's why a sage inhabits the complexity of things and so avoids all complexity.
