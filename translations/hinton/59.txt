To govern people and serve heaven
there's nothing like thrift.
Thrift means submitting early,
and submitting early means storing up Integrity.
Store up Integrity and nothing is beyond you.
Once nothing is beyond you,
no one knows where it will all end.
Once no one knows where it will end,
you can nurture a nation.
And nurturing the nation's mother too
you can last and last.
This is called rooted deep and solid,
the Way of long life and enduring insight.
