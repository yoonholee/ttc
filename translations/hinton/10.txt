Can you let your spirit embrace primal unity without drifting away?
Can you focus ch'i into such softness you're a newborn again?
Can you polish the dark-enigma mirror to a clarity beyond stain?
Can you make loving the people and ruling the nation nothing's own doing?
Can you be female opening and closing heaven's gate?
Can you fathom earth's four distances with radiant wisdom and know nothing?
Give birth and nurture.
Give birth without possessing and foster without dominating:
this is called dark-enigma Integrity.
