Those who know don't talk, and those who talk don't know.
Block the senses and close the mind,
blunt edges, loosen tangles, soften glare, mingle dust:
this is called dark-enigma union.
It can't be embraced and can't be ignored,
can't be enhanced and can't be harmed,
can't be treasured and can't be despised,
for it's the treasure of all beneath heaven.
