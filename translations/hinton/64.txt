It's easy to embrace the tranquil
and easy to prevent trouble before omens appear.
It's easy for the trifling to melt away
and easy for the slight to scatter away.
Work at things before they've begun
and establish order before confusion sets in,
for a tree you can barely reach around
grows from the tiniest rootlet,
a nine-tiered tower
starts as a basket of dirt,
a thousand-mile journey
begins with a single step.
Work at things and you ruin them; cling to things and you lose them.
That's why a sage does nothing and so ruins nothing, clings to nothing and so loses nothing.
When people devote themselves to something they always ruin it on the verge of success.
Finish with the same care you took in beginning and you'll avoid ruining things.
This is why a sage desires without desire,
never longing for rare treasures,
learns without learning,
always returning to what people have passed by,
helps the ten thousand things occur of themselves by never presuming to work at them.
