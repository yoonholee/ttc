Heaven goes on forever.
Earth endures forever.
There's a reason heaven and earth go on enduring forever:
their life isn't their own so their life goes on forever.
Hence, in putting himself last the sage puts himself first, and in giving himself up he preserves himself.
If you aren't free of yourself
how will you ever become yourself?
