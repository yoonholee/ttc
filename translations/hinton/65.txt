Ancient masters of Way
never enlightened people.
They kept people simple-minded.
It's impossible to govern
once you've filled people with knowing.
Use knowing to govern
and you plunder the nation,
but use not-knowing to govern
and you enrich the nation.
Once you understand this, the pattern is clear,
and always understanding the pattern is called dark-enigma Integrity.
Dark-enigma Integrity is deep and distant, is the return of things
back into the vast harmony.
