The loftiest ruler is barely known among those below.
Next comes a ruler people love and praise.
After that, one they fear, and then one they despise.
If you don't stand sincere by your words
how sincere can the people be?
Take great care over words, treasure them,
and when the hundred-fold people see
your work succeed in all they do
they'll say it's just occurrence appearing of itself.
