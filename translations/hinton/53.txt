Understanding sparse and sparser still I travel the great Way, nothing to fear unless I stray.
The great Way is open and smooth, but people adore twisty paths:
Government in ruins, fields overgrown and graineries bare,
they indulge in elegant robes
and sharp swords,
lavish food and drink,
all those trappings of luxury.
It's vainglorious thievery -
not the Way, not the Way at all.
