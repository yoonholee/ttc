Never bestow honors and people won't quarrel.
Never prize rare treasures and people won't steal.
Never flaunt alluring things and people won't be confused.
This is how a sage governs.
Fill bellies and empty minds,
strengthen bones and weaken ambition,
always keep the people from knowing and wanting,
then those who know are those who never presume to act.
If you're nothing doing what you do all things will be governed well.
