Govern a great nation as you would cook a small fish.
Use Way to rule all beneath heaven and spirits never become ghosts.
When spirits don't become ghosts, ghosts do people no harm.
When ghosts do people no harm, sages do them no harm.
And once humans and ghosts do each other no harm, they return together to Integrity.
