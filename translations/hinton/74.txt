In their misery, the people no longer fear death, so how can you threaten them even with death?
Let the people fear death always,
then if we seize those who follow sinister ways
and put them to death,
no one will dare live such lives.
The Executioner's killing is perennial, it's true.
But to undertake the killing yourself -
that's like trying to carve lumber for a master carpenter.
Try to carve lumber for a master carpenter
and you'll soon have blood on your hands.
