Way is perennially nameless,
an uncarved simplicity.
Though small,
it's subject to nothing in all beneath heaven.
But when lords or emperors foster it,
the ten thousand things gladly become their guests,
heaven mingling with earth sends down sweet dew,
and the people free of mandates share justice among themselves.
When a governing blade begins carving it up, names arise.
Once names arise,
know that it's time to stop.
Knowing when to stop, you can avoid danger.
Way flowing through all beneath heaven:
it's like valley streams flowing into rivers and seas.
