Forcing it fuller and fuller can't compare to just enough,
and honed sharper and sharper means it won't keep for long.
Once it's full of jade and gold your house will never be safe.
Proud of wealth and renown you bring on your own ruin.
Just do what you do, and then leave: such is the Way of heaven.
