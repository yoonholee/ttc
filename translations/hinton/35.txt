Holding to the great image all beneath heaven sets out:
sets out free of risk, peace tranquil and vast.
Music and savory food
entice travelers to stop,
but the Way uttered forth
isn't even the thinnest of bland flavors.
Look at it: not enough to see.
Listen to it: not enough to hear.
Use it: not enough to use up.
