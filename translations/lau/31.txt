The gentleman gives precedence to the left when at home, but to theright when he goes to war.
Arms are instruments of ill omen, not the instruments of the gentleman.
When one is compelled to use them, it is best to do so without relish.
There is no glory in victory, and so to glorify it despite this isto exult in the killing of men.
One who exults in the killing of men will never have his way in theempire.
On occasions of rejoicing precedence is given to the left;
On occasions of mourning precedence is given to the right.
A lieutenants place is on the left;
The general's place is on the right.
This means that it is mourning rites that are observed.
When great numbers of people are killed, one should weep over themwith sorrow.
When victorious in war, one should observe the rites of mourning.
