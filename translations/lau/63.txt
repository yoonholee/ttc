Do that which consists in taking no action;
Pursue that which is not meddlesome;
Savor that which has no flavor.

Make the small big and the few many;
Do good to him who has done you an injury.

Lay plans for the accomplishment of the difficult before it becomesdifficult;
Make something big by starting with it when small.

Difficult things in the word must needs have their beginnings in theeasy;
Big things must needs have their beginnings in the small.

Therefore it is because the sage never attempts to be great that hesucceeds in becoming great.

One who makes promises rashly rarely keeps good faith;
One who is in the habit of considering things easy meets with frequentdifficulties.

Therefore even the sage treats some things as difficult.
That is why in the end no difficulties can get the better of him.
