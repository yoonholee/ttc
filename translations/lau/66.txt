The reason why the River and the Sea are able to be king of the hundredvalleys is that they excel in taking the lower position.
Hence they are able to be king of the hundred valleys.

Therefore, desiring to rule over the people,
One must in one's words humble oneself before them;
And, desiring to lead the people,
One must, in one's person, follow behind them.

takes his place ahead of the people yet causes no obstruction.
That is why the empire supports him joyfully and never tires of doingso.

It is because he does not contend that no one in the empire is in aposition to contend with him.
