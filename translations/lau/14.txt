What cannot be seen is called evanescent;
What cannot be heard is called rarefied;
What cannot be touched is called minute.

Its upper part is not dazzling;
Its lower part is not obscure.

And returns to that which is without substance.

Follow behind it and you will not see its rear.

In order to keep in control the realm of today.
The ability to know the beginning of antiquity
Is called the thread running through the way.
