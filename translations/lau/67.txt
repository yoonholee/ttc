The whole world says that my way is vast and resembles nothing.
It is because it is vast that it resembles nothing.
If it resembled anything, it would, long before now, have become small.

I have three treasures
Which I hold and cherish.
The first is known as compassion,
The second is known as frugality,
The third is known as not daring to take the lead in the empire;
Being compassionate one could afford to be courageous,
Being frugal one could afford to extend one's territory,
Not daring to take the lead in the empire one could afford to be lordover the vessels.

Now, to forsake compassion for courage, to forsake frugality for expansion,to forsake the rear for the lead, is sure to end in death.

Through compassion, one will triumph in attack and be impregnable indefence.
What heaven succours it protects with the gift of compassion.
