Highest good is like water.
Because water excels in benefiting the myriad creatures without contendingwith them and settles where none would like to be, it comes close to theway.

In a home it is the site that matters;
In quality of mind it is depth that matters;
In an ally it is benevolence that matters;
In speech it is good faith that matters;
In government it is order that matters;
In affairs it is ability that matters;
In action it is timeliness that matters.

It is because it does not contend that it is never at fault.
