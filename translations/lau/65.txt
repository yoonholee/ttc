Of old those who excelled in the pursuit of the way did not use itto enlighten the people but to hoodwink them.
The reason why the people are difficult to govern is that they aretoo clever.

Hence to rule a state by cleverness
Will be to the detriment of the state;
Not to rule a state by cleverness
Will be a boon to the state.
These two are models.
Always to know the models
Is known as mysterious virtue.
Mysterious virtue is profound and far-reaching,
But when things turn back it turns back with them.

Only then is complete conformity realized.
