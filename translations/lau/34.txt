The way is broad, reaching left as well as right.
The myriad creatures depend on it for life yet it claims no authority.
It accomplishes its task yet lays claim to no merit.
It clothes and feeds the myriad creatures yet lays no claim to beingtheir master.

For ever free of desire, it can be called small;
Yet as it lays no claim to being master when the myriad creatures turnto it, it can be called great.

It is because it never attempts itself to become great that it succeedsin becoming great.
