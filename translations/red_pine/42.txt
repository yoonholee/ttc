The Tao gives birth to one one gives birth to two two gives birth to three three gives birth to ten thousand things
ten thousand things with yin at their backs and yang in their embrace and breath between for harmony
what the world hates to be orphaned widowed or destitute kings use for their titles
thus some gain by losing others lose by gaining
thus what people teach I teach too tyrants never choose their deaths this becomes my teacher
