Whispered words are natural a gale doesn't last all morning a squall doesn't last all day
who else could make these only Heaven and Earth if Heaven and Earth can't make things last what about Man
thus in whatever we do let those on the Way be one with the Way let those who succeed be one with success let those who fail be one with failure
be one with success for the Way succeeds too be one with failure for the Way fails too
