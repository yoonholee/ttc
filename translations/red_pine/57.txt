Use direction to govern a country use indirection to fight a war use inaction to rule the world how do we know this works
the greater the prohibitions the poorer the people the sharper the weapons the darker the realm
the smarter the scheme the stranger the outcome the finer the treasure the thicker the thieves
thus the sage declares I change nothing and the people transform themselves I stay still and the people adjust themselves
I do nothing and the people enrich themselves I want nothing and the people simplify themselves
