In warfare there is a saying rather than a host better to be a guest rather than advance an inch better to retreat a foot
this means to form no column to wear no armour to brandish no weapon to repulse no enemy
no fate is worse than to have no enemy without an enemy we would lose our treasure
thus when opponents are evenly matched the remorseful one prevails
