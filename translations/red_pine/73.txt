Daring to act means death daring not to act means life
of these two one benefits one harms what Heaven hates who knows the reasons
the Way of Heaven wins easily without a fight answers wisely without a word comes quickly without a summons plans ingeniously without a thought
the Net of Heaven is all-embracing it mesh is wide but nothing escapes
