When a great person hears of the Way he follows it with devotion when an average person hears of the Way he doesn't know if it's real or not
when a small person hears of the Way he laughs out loud if he didn't laugh it wouldn't be the Way
hence these sayings arose the brightest path seems dark the quickest path seems slow the smoothest path seems rough the highest virtue low the whitest white pitch-black the greatest virtue wanting
the staunchest virtue timid the truest truth uncertain the perfect square lacks corners the perfect tool does nothing the perfect sound is hushed the perfect form is shapeless
the Tao is hidden and has no name but because it's the Tao it knows how to start and how to finish
