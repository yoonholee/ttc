Bestowing no honours keeps people from fighting
prizing no treasures keeps people from stealing
displaying no attractions keeps people from making trouble
thus the rule of the sage empties the mind but fills the stomach weakens the will but strengthens the bones
by keeping the people from knowing or wanting and those who know from daring to act
he thus governs them all
