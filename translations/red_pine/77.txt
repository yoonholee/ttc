The Way of Heaven is like stringing a bow pulling sown the high lifting up the low shortening the long lengthening the short
the Way of Heaven takes from the long and supplements the short unlike the Way of Man taking from the short and giving to the long
who can find the long and give it to the world only those who find the Way
thus the sage does not presume on what he does or claim what he achieves thus he chooses to hide his skill
