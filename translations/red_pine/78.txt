Nothing in the world is weaker than water but against the hard and the strong nothing excels it for nothing can change it
the soft overcomes the hard the weak overcomes the strong this is something everyone knows but no one is able to practice
thus the sage declares who accepts a country's disgrace we call the lord of soil and grain who accepts a country's misfortune we call king of all under Heaven upright words sound upside down
