Let limits be empty the center be still
ten thousand things rise we watch them return creatures without number all return to their roots
return to their roots to be still to be still to revive to revive to endure knowing how to endure is wisdom not knowing is to suffer in vain
knowing how to endure is to be all-embracing all embracing means impartial impartial means the king the king means Heaven Heaven means the Way
and the Way means long life life without trouble.
