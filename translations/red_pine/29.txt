Trying to govern the world with force I see this not succeeding
the world is a spiritual thing it can't be forced to force it is to harm it to control it is to lose it
sometimes things lead sometimes they follow sometimes blow hot sometimes blow cold sometimes expand sometimes collapse
therefore the sage avoids extremes avoids extravagance avoids excess
