He who contains virtue in abundance resembles a newborn child wasps don't sting him beasts don't claw him birds of prey don't carry him off his bones are weak and his tendons are soft and yet his grip is firm
he hasn't known the union of sexes and yet his penis is stiff so full of essence is he
he cries all day yet ever gets hoarse so full of breath is he who knows how to breath endures who knows how to endure is wise
who lengthens his life tempts luck who breathes with his will is strong
but virility means old age this isn't the Way what isn't the Way ends early
