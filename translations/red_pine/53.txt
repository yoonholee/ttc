Were I sufficiently wise I would follow the Great Way and only fear going astray
the Great Way is smooth but people love byways
their palaces are spotless their fields are overgrown and their granaries are empty
they wear fine clothes they carry sharp swords they tire of food and drink and possess more than they need this is called robbery and robbery is not the Way
