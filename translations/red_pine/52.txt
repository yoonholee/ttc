The world has a maiden she becomes the world's mother
who knows the mother understands the child who understands the child keeps the mother safe and lives without trouble
who blocks the opening who closes the gate lives without toil
who unblocks the opening who meddles in affairs lives without hope
who sees the small has vision who protects the weak has strength
who uses his light who trusts his vision lives beyond death this is the Hidden Immortal
