The world calls me great great but useless because I am great I am useless if I were of use I would have stayed small
but I possess three treasures I treasure and uphold first is compassion second is austerity third is reluctance to excel
because I am compassionate I can be valiant because I am austere I can be extravagant because I am reluctant to excel I can be chief of all tools
if I renounced compassion for valour austerity for extravagance reluctance for supremacy I would die
compassion wins every battle and outlasts every attack what Heaven creates let compassion protect
