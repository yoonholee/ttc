Use the Tao to help your king don't use weapons to rule the land such things soon return
where armies camp brambles grow
best to win then stop don't make use of force
win but don't be proud win but don't be vain win but don't be cruel win when you have no choice this is to win without force
virility means old age this isn't the Tao what isn't the Tao ends early
