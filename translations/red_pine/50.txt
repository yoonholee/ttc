Appearing means life disappearing means death
thirteen are the followers of life thirteen are the followers of death but people living to live join the land of death's thirteen and why because they live to live
it's said that those who guard life well aren't injured by soldiers in battle or harmed by rhinos or tigers in the wild
for rhinos have nowhere to sink their horns tigers have nowhere to sink their claws and soldiers have nowhere to sink their blades and why because for them there is no land of death
