The great state is a watershed the confluence of the world the female of the world through stillness the female conquers the male in order to be still she needs to be lower
the great state that is lower governs the small state the small state that is lower is governed by the great state
some lower themselves to govern some lower themselves to be governed
the great state's only desire is to unite and lead others the small state's only desire is to join and serve others
for both to achieve their desire the greater needs to be lower
