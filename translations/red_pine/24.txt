Who tiptoes doesn't stand who strides doesn't walk
who watches himself doesn't appear who displays himself doesn't flourish
who flatters himself achieves nothing who parades himself doesn't lead
on the road they say too much food and a tiring pace some things are simply bad thus the Taoist avoids them
