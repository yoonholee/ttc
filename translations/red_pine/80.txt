Imagine a small state with a small population let there be labour-saving tools that aren't used let people consider death and not move far
let there be boats and carts but no reason to ride them let there be armour and weapons but no reason to employ them
let people return to the use of knots and be satisfied with their food and pleased with their clothing and content with their homes and happy with their customs
let there be a state so near people hear its dogs and chickens and live out their lives without making a visit
