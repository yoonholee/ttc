Act without acting work without working taste without tasting
great or small many or few repay each wrong with virtue
plan for the hard while it's easy work on the great while it's small
the hardest task in the world begins easy the greatest goal in the world begins small
therefore the sage never acts great he thus achieves great things
who quickly agrees is seldom trusted who makes it all easy finds it all hard
therefore the sage makes everything hard he thus finds nothing hard
