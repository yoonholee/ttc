Weapons are not auspicious tools some things are simply bad thus the Taoist shuns them
in peace the ruler honours the left in war he honours the right
weapons are not auspicious weapons are not a ruler's tools he wields them when he has no choice dispassion is the best
thus he does not beautify them he who beautifies them enjoys killing others he who enjoys killing others achieves no worldly rule
thus we honour the left for joy we honour the right for sorrow the left is where the adjutant stands the commander on the right
which means at a funeral when you kill another honour him with your tears when the battle is won treat it as a wake
the first distinction gives us names after we have names we should know restraint who knows restraint knows no trouble
