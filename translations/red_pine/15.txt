The ancient masters of the Way aimed at the indiscernible and penetrated the dao
you would never know them I describe them with reluctance they were careful as if crossing a river in winter cautious as if worried about neighbours reserved like guests
ephemeral like melting ice simple like uncarved wood open like valleys and murky like puddles
but a puddle becomes clear when it's still and stillness becomes alive when it's roused
those who treasure this Way don't try to be full not trying to be full they can hide and stay hidden
