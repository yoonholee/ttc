Good walking leaves no tracks good talking reveals no flaws good counting counts no beads
good closing locks no locks and yet it can't be opened good tying ties no knots and yet it can't be undone
thus the sage is good at saving and yet abandons no one nor anything of use this is called cloaking the light
thus the good instruct the bad the bad learn from the good
not honouring their teachers not cherishing their students the wise alone are perfectly blind this is called peering into the distance
