Favour and disgrace are like warnings honour and disaster are like the body
and why are favour and disgrace like warnings favour means descending to gain it is like a warning to lose it is like a warning thus are favour and disgrace like warnings
and why are honour and disaster like the body the reason we have disaster is because we have a body if we didn't have a body we wouldn't have disaster
who honours is body as much as the world can be entrusted with the world who loves his body as much as the world can be encharged with the world
