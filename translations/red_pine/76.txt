When people are born they are soft and supple when they perish they are hard and stiff
when plants shoot forth they are soft and tender when they die they are withered and dry
thus it is said the hard and strong are followers of death the soft and weak are followers of life
when an army becomes strong it suffers defeat when a plant becomes hard it snaps
the hard and strong dwell below the soft and weak dwell above
