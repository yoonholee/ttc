Partial means whole crooked means straight hollow means full worn-out means new less means content more means confused

not watching himself he appears not displaying himself he flourishes not flattering himself he succeeds not parading himself he leads
because he doesn't compete no one can compete against him
the ancients who said partial means whole came close indeed becoming whole depends on this
