True words aren't beautiful beautiful words aren't true
the good aren't eloquent the eloquent aren't good
the wise aren't learned the learned aren't wise
the sage accumulates nothing but the more he does for others the greater his existence the more he gives to others the greater his abundance
the Way of Heaven is to help without harming the Way of the sage is to act without struggling
