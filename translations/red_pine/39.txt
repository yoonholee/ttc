Of things that became one in the past Heaven became one and was clear Earth became one and was still spirits became one and were active
streams became one and were full kings became one and ruled the world
but by implication Heaven would crack if it were always clear Earth would crumble if it were always still spirits would fail
if they were always active streams would dry up if they were always full kings would fall if they were always high and noble
thus the noble is based on the humble the high is founded on the low
thus do kings refer to themselves as orphaned widowed and destitute but this is the basis of humility
counting a carriage as no carriage at all
not wanting to clink like jade they clunk like rocks
