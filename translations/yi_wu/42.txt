The Way brings forth one,
One brings forth two,
Two bring forth three,
Three bring forth all things.
All things carry the dark and embrace the light
and make them harmonize with empty energy.
People dislike "the lonely one", "the little one", and "the worthless one",
But kings and dukes call themselves by these names.
Therefore, everything may gain by losing
and may lose by gaining.
What people teach, I also teach:
"The man of violence will not die well."
I will take this as the father of my teaching.
