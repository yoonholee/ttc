Military strategists have a saying,
"I dare not be a host; rather, a guest.
I dare not advance an inch; rather, retreat a foot."
This can be called
marching without formation,
striving without arms,
overthrowing without enmity,
capturing without weapons.
There is no greater calamity than to underestimate an enemy.
To underestimate an enemy is to lose one's treasures.
Therefore, when opposing armies try to overcome each other,
One who sorrows will win.
