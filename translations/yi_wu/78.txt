Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,
But those who attack the hard and strong cannot conquer it,
Because nothing can change it.
The weak wins over the strong,
The soft wins over the tough.
Everyone in the world knows this,
But no one can practice it.
Therefore, the sage says,
To accept the state's sordid aspects is to be the lord of the state.
To accept the state's ill omens is to be the king of the world.
True words sound like their opposite.
