Govern the country correctly,
Use the army trickily,
Have the world by doing nothing.
How can I know that is so?
By these:
The more taboos and prohibitions there are in the world,
the poorer the people are.
The more sharp weapons the people have,
the more chaotic the nation is.
The more craft and skill people have,
the more strange things happen.
The more laws and commands a nation has,
the more robbers and thieves there are.
Therefore, the sage says:
I am in non-action, and the people transform themselves.
I like to be tranquil, and the people correct themselves.
I do not interfere, and the people prosper naturally.
I have no desires, and the people return naturally to simplicity.
