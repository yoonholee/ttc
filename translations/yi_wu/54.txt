What is well established cannot be uprooted.
What is well embraced cannot slip away.
[Practicing these], one's descendants will offer sacrifices without end.
Cultivate them in oneself, one's virtue will be true.
Cultivate them in the family, one's virtue will increase.
Cultivate them in the community, one's virtue will develop.
Cultivate them in the country, one's virtue will be abundant.
Cultivate them in the world, one's virtue will be universal.
Therefore,
by the self, contemplate the self;
by the family, contemplate the family;
by the community, contemplate the community;
by the country, contemplate the country;
by the world, contemplate the world.
How can I know about the world as such?
By these.
