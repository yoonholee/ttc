The Way brings them forth,
Virtue nurtures them,
Matter shapes them,
Environment forms them.
Therefore, all things without exception venerate the Way and value virtue.
The Way's venerability and virtue's value
are that they do not command but constantly are natural.
Therefore, the Way brings them forth,
Virtue nurtures them,
Grows them and rears them,
Matures them and ripens them,
Nourishes them and shelters them.
Producing without possessing,
Acting without taking credit,
Growing without controlling, --
This is called mystical virtue.
