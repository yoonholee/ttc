Favor is like disgrace, which startles us.
Big troubles should be treated as seriously as our bodies.
What is meant by, "Favor is like disgrace, which startles us"?
Favor is lowly.
Getting it startles us;
Losing it startles us;
Thus, favor is like disgrace, which startles us.
What is meant by, "Big troubles are treated as seriously as our bodies"?
The reason that we have big troubles is that we possess bodies.
If we did not possess bodies, what troubles could we have?
Therefore,
only the man who values himself for the sake of the world
is worthy of being entrusted with the world;
only the man who loves himself for the sake of the world
is worthy of being relied on by the world.
