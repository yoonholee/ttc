The reason rivers and seas are able to be the kings of all valleys
Is because they excel in taking the lowest places.
So, they become the kings of all valleys.
Therefore, one who wants to be above the people
Surely must, in words, be below them.
One who wants to stay before people
Surely must, in body, stay behind them.
Therefore, though the Sage's place is above,
The people are not burdened.
The Sage is ahead,
But the people are not obstructed.
Therefore, the world happily praises and does not tire of him.
Because he does not compete,
The world cannot compete with him.
