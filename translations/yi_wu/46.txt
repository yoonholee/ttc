When the world is with the Way,
Galloping horses are sent back for dung.
When the world is without the Way,
War horses are raised in the suburbs.
No calamity is greater than not knowing contentment;
No trouble is greater than desiring gain.
Therefore, the contentment of knowing contentment is constant contentment.
