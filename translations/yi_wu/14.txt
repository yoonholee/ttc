Looking at it, one cannot see it;
it is named the invisible.
Listening to it, one cannot hear it;
it is named the inaudible.
Grasping at it, one cannot get it;
it is named the immaterial.
These three cannot be inquired into;
therefore, they are blended into one.
Above it, there is no light;
below it, there is no darkness.
Continually!
Infinitely!
Unnameable, it returns again to the no-thingness.
This is called the form of the formless, the image of nothingness.
This is called the vague, the elusive.
Meeting it, one does not see its face;
Following it, one does not see its back.
If one holds to the Way of ancient times,
one can manage existence in the present.
That one can know the origin,
is called the record of the Way.
