If I, subtly, have knowledge,
Walking in the great Way,
My only fear is to act on it.
The great Way is very level,
But the people prefer short cuts.
The court is very remote;
The fields are very weedy;
The storehouses are very empty.
But officials wear gorgeous garments,
Carry sharp swords,
Are surfeited with food and drink,
And possess more money and goods than they can use.
This is called, "to steal reputation."
This is not the Way!
