There was something formed in chaos;
It existed before heaven and earth.
Still and solitary,
It alone stands without change.
It is all-pervasive without being exhausted.
It may be the mother of the world.
I do not know its name, but name it the Way.
With reluctance, I call it Great.
Great means on-going;
On-going means far-reaching;
Far-reaching means reversing;
Therefore, the Way is great.
Heaven is great;
Earth is great;
The king also is great.
In this realm there are four great things,
And the king is one of them.
Man follows Earth;
Earth follows Heaven;
Heaven follows the Way;
The Way follows its nature.
