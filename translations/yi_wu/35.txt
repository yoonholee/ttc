He who holds to the great image
Will be followed by the people of the world.
They will go unharmed,
In safety, calm, and peace.
Music and good food tempt passing guests to pause;
[But,] the Way that is tasted has no flavor,
Looked at, it cannot be seen,
Listened to, it cannot be heard,
Used, it cannot be exhausted.
