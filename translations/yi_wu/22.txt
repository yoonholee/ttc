To bend is to be whole.
To crook is to be straightened.
To be hollow is to be filled.
To be worn out is to be renewed.
To have little is to gain more.
To wish for more is to be confused.
Therefore, the sage embraces oneness to become the pattern for the world.
By not being self-opinionated, he becomes enlightened.
By not being self-righteous, he becomes manifest.
By not being self-glorified, he has merit.
By not being self-satisfied, he develops well.
He alone does not compete with anyone;
so, no one can compete with him.
Is the ancient saying, "To bend is to be whole", an idle word?
Truly, the whole will return to him.
