In ancient times, one who was good at practicing the Way
Did not make the people clever
But kept them in ignorance.
If the people are hard to govern,
It is because they have too much knowledge.
Therefore,
one who governs the state with knowledge is a malefactor to the state;
one who does not govern the state with knowledge is a benefactor to the state.
Knowing both of these is also knowing to follow the pattern.
Constantly knowing to follow the pattern
Is called mystical virtue.
Mystical virtue reaches deep and far;
It returns with all things,
After which, supreme harmony will be attained.
