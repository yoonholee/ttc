The supremely good [man] is like water.
Water is good at benefiting all things
but does not compete with them.
It dwells in places that people dislike;
therefore, it is close to the Way.
In dwelling, he is good at living close to the ground.
In mind, he is good at making himself like an abyss.
In giving, he is good at practicing humanity.
In speaking, he is good at keeping his word.
In governing, he is good at managing.
In doing, he is good at using his abilities.
In moving, he is good at discerning the right time.
Because he does not compete with others, he will be free from blame.
