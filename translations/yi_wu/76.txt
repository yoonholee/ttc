One who is living is soft and weak.
One who is dead is hard and rigid.
All living things, like grass and trees, are soft and frail.
With death, they become withered and dry.
Therefore, hardness and rigidity are associated with death.
Softness and weakness are associated with life.
Therefore, powerful weapons will not win;
Massive trees will be cut down;
The strong and great will be laid low;
The soft and weak will be exalted.
