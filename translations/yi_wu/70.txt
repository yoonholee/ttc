My words are very easy to understand
and very easy to practice,
But the world cannot understand them
and cannot practice them.
My words have their primal meaning;
My deeds have their principle.
Only I am without knowledge;
Therefore, I am not known.
If those who know me are few,
Then, what I have is of value.
Therefore, the sage is covered by coarse clothes, but embraces jade.
