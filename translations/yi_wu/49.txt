The sage's mind is not unchangeable;
He regards the people's mind as his mind.
He is good to those who are good;
He also is good to those who are not good.
This is the virtue of goodness.
He trusts those who are trustworthy;
He also trusts those who are not trustworthy.
This is the virtue of trustfulness.
The sage, in the world,
Harmoniously merges his mind with the world's.
The people all strain their ears and eyes;
The sage regards them as children.
