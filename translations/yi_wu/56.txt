One who is wise does not speak;
One who speaks is not wise.
Blocking the passages,
Shutting the doors,
Blunting the sharpness,
Untying the tangles,
Tempering the brightness,
Uniting with the dust, --
This is called the mystical union.
Therefore,
There is no way to get close to it;
There is no way to leave it;
There is no way to benefit it;
There is no way to harm it;
There is no way to value it;
There is no way to despise it;
Therefore, it is revered in the world.
