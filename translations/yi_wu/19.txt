Transcend sagacity and abandon intellect;
The people will be benefited a hundredfold.
Transcend humanity and abandon righteousness;
The people will return to filial piety and paternal kindness.
Transcend craftiness and abandon profit;
Robbers and thieves no longer will exist.
These three are but ornaments, and inadequate;
Therefore, they should be subordinated.
Appear plain and embrace simplicity;
Reduce selfishness and restrain desires.
