All the world says that my Way is too great to be like a thing.
It alone is great; so, it seems like no thing.
If it were like a thing, it would be already small.
I have three treasures to be kept and protected:
The first is called compassion;
The second is called thrift;
The third is called not daring to be ahead of the world.
Compassionate, one can be brave;
Thrifty, one can be expansive;
Not daring to be ahead of the world, one is able to be the leader.
Now,
Bravery without compassion,
Expansiveness without thrift,
Going ahead without retreat,
Is fatal.
Compassion,
In war, will result in victory;
In defense, will result in holding firm.
When Heaven is going to save someone,
It protects him with compassion.
