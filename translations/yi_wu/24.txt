One who is on tiptoe cannot stand.
One who strides cannot walk.
One who is self-opinionated is not enlightened.
One who is self-righteous is not brightened.
One who is self-glorified is without merit.
One who is self-satisfied cannot develop.
To the Way, all of them are known as
"Unwanted food and useless actions."
They may be despised by all things;
Therefore, one who practices the Way does not dwell on them.
