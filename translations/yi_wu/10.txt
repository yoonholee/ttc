To keep the spirit and body embracing Oneness,
can you let them not be separate?
To concentrate the breath for attaining softness,
can you be like an infant?
To wash and clear the mysterious vision,
can you eliminate all flaws?
To love the people and govern the state,
can you be without knowledge?
To open and close the Heavenly gates,
can you be the female?
To understand all things in the four directions,
can you be in non-action?
To produce them and nourish them,
To produce without possessing,
To act without taking credit,
To [encourage] growth without controlling,
This is called mysterious virtue.
