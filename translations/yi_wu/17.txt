The best ruler: the people merely know he exists.
Next best: the people love and praise him.
Next: the people fear him.
Lowest: the people despise him.
Because he does not trust enough,
he will not be trusted by others.
Silent, the best ruler values his words.
When he has achieved merit and completed his works,
the people all say, "We did it ourselves."
