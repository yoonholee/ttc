The world has a beginning;
It is the mother of the world.
Having the mother,
One can know the son.
Having known the son,
One should stay with the mother;
Then, to the end of one's life, there will be no danger.
Block the passages;
Shut the doors;
To the end of one's life, there will be no toil.
Open the passages;
Do all things;
To the end of one's life, there will be no salvation.
To know the small is called enlightenment;
To keep to the soft is called strength.
Use brightness and return to enlightenment.
Do not bring calamities upon oneself.
This is to practice constancy.
