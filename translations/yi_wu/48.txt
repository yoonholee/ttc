To pursue learning is to increase daily.
To practice the Way is to decrease daily.
Decreasing and more decreasing,
One arrives at non-action.
Non-action, but nothing is left undone.
To have the world, one always should be in doing nothing.
If one is busy in doing something,
One cannot have the world.
