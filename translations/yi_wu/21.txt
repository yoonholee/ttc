The attitude of grand virtue is to follow only the Way.
The Way is like something elusive and evasive.
Within it there is image, evasive and elusive.
Within it there is matter, elusive and evasive.
Within it there is essence, dim and dark.
The essence is very real,
Within it there is evidence of reality.
From ancient times to now,
Its name has not disappeared.
By it one can see the source of all things.
How could I know the source of all things?
By this.
