If it wants to close anything, surely it will first open it.
If it wants to weaken anything, surely it will first strengthen it.
If it wants to abandon anything, surely it will first allow it to arise.
If it wants to take away anything, surely it will first give it.
This is called the subtle enlightenment.
The soft and the weak win over the hard and the strong.
Fish cannot leave the deep water.
The state's sharpest weapons cannot be shown to people.
