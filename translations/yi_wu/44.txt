Of fame and body, which is dearer?
Of body and property, which is worth more?
Of gain and loss, which is more troublesome?
Therefore, excessive love surely is great waste.
Much storing up surely is a heavy loss.
To know when you have enough
is to avoid disgrace.
To know when to stop
is to be free from danger.
Only thus can one long endure.
