The Way constantly is nameless.
Although its simplicity makes it seem trivial,
No one can subjugate it.
If dukes and kings can keep to it,
All things will naturally behave as guests.
Heaven and earth will unite with each other,
And sweet dew will fall.
People, without being commanded,
Will be equal to each other.
In the beginning of creation,
All things were given names.
When names are given,
One must know when to stop.
Knowing when to stop,
One will be free from danger.
The Way is to the world
As the great rivers and oceans
Are to streams in the valleys.
