Nature rarely speaks.
So, a whirlwind does not last all morning,
Nor does a sudden shower last the whole day.
Who causes these? Heaven and earth.
If what Heaven and earth do cannot last long,
What can man do?
Therefore, one who follows the Way is in accord with the Way.
One who practices virtue is in accord with virtue.
One who loses is in accord with loss.
To be in accord with the Way is to be accepted gladly by the Way.
To be in accord with virtue is to be accepted gladly by virtue.
To be in accord with loss is to be accepted gladly by loss.
When a man is not sincere enough
He will not be trusted.
