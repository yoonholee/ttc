Those of ancient times attained oneness.
Heaven attained oneness and became clear;
Earth attained oneness and became calm;
Spirits attained oneness and became divine;
Valleys attained oneness and became full;
All things attained oneness and came to life;
Dukes and kings attained oneness and became models for the world.
All was achieved by oneness.
Heaven, without [oneness], becoming clear, might crack;
Earth, without [oneness], becoming calm, might explode;
Spirits, without [oneness], becoming divine, might be exhausted;
Valleys, without [oneness], becoming full, might dry up;
All things, without [oneness], receiving life, might perish;
Dukes and kings, without [oneness], becoming honorable, might fall.
Therefore, the superior takes the inferior as its root.
The high recognizes the low as its foundation.
Therefore, dukes and kings call themselves
"the lonely one", "the little one", and "the worthless one".
Is this not to recognize the lowly as the root?
Is not this?
Therefore, those who wish for great reputation have no reputation.
We do not want to be bright as jade or hard as stone.
