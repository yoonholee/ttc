The greatest achievement seems imperfect, yet its usefulness is never exhausted.
The greatest fullness seems empty, yet its usefulness is endless.
The greatest straightness seems bent.
The greatest skill seems clumsy.
The greatest eloquence seems like stammering.
Restlessness wins over cold.
Tranquility wins over heat.
Pure tranquility is the norm of the world.
