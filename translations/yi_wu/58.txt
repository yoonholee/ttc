When the government is obscure and withdrawn,
The people are simple and honest.
When the government inspects and reinspects,
The people lack [morality and virtue].
Bad fortune is what good fortune depends on;
Good fortune is what bad fortune hides in.
Who knows the ultimate end?
There is no norm.
Normality turns out to be odd;
Goodness turns out to be bad.
People's confusion has been long.
Therefore, the sage is
upright but not cutting,
incorruptible but not harmful,
straight but not reckless,
bright but not dazzling.
