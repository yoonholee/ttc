Heaven is eternal and Earth is everlasting.
The reason they can last forever
Is because they do not live for themselves.
So, they can live long.
Therefore, the sage places himself behind,
But actually he goes ahead;
Neglects himself,
But actually preserves himself.
Is it not because he has no self
That his self is realized?
