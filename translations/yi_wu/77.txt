Is not the way of Heaven like the stringing of a bow?
The upper part is depressed,
The lower part is raised;
The too-long string is shortened,
The too-short string is added to.
The way of Heaven reduces excesses and makes-up deficiencies.
The path of man is not so;
It decreases the deficient to supply the excessive.
Who can have more to offer to the world?
Only the man with the Way.
Therefore, the sage acts without taking credit,
Achieves without attachment.
He does not want to display his worthiness.
