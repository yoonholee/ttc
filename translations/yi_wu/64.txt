What is at rest is easy to hold;
What has not yet appeared is easy to plan.
What is fragile is easy to shatter;
What is small is easy to scatter.
Act before the problem happens;
Manage before disorder arises.
A tree as big as one's embrace springs from a tiny sprout;
A tower with nine stories starts from a heap of earth;
A walk of a thousand miles begins from where one stands.
One who acts will fail;
One who becomes attached will lose.
Therefore, the sage, without acting, does not fail,
Without becoming attached, does not lose.
The people, in doing, fail at the point of success.
One should be as cautious at the end as at the beginning;
Then there will be no failure.
Therefore, the sage desires to be desireless
And does not value rare treasures,
Learns to be unlearned
And reforms the faults of people.
He aids all things in their natural development
And dares to not act on them.
