Transcend learning; there will be no sorrow.
Between "yea" and "nay", what is the difference?
Between "good" and "evil", what is the distinction?
What other people fear, I cannot but fear.
Of wandering, there will be no end.
Most people are busy coming and going
As if enjoying a feast,
As if ascending a tower in the springtime.
I alone am unmoved, showing no sign,
Like a baby who has not yet become a child;
Weary, as if I have no home to return to.
Most people have more than enough; I alone seem to be left out.
My mind is like a fool's! Chaotic, chaotic!
Ordinary people are bright; I alone am dim.
Ordinary people inspect [everything]; I alone am obscurant,
Indifferent as the sea, endless as a high wind.
Most people are reasonable; I alone am stubborn and mean.
I am different from others; I value being fed by the Mother.
