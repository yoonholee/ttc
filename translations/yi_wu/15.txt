In ancient times, the men who cultivated the Way shared its essence, subtlety, mystery, and penetration.
They were deep and beyond knowing.
Because they were beyond knowing, we try only to describe them:
Cautious, as if crossing a river in winter;
Hesitant, as if fearing the neighbors on all sides;
Serious, as if a guest;
Expansive, as if melting ice;
Sincere, as if an uncarved block;
Vast, as if a valley;
Chaotic, as if turbid [water].
Who can stop turbidity, clarifies it gradually through tranquility.
Who can create lasting peace, produces it gradually through movement.
The men who protect this Way do not want to be too full;
only by not being too full can they remain under cover,
without new achievements.
