When the highest scholars hear of the Way, they practice it diligently.
When average scholars hear of the Way, they doubt its existence.
When the lowest scholars hear of the Way, they laugh loudly at it.
Without their laughing, it would not be the Way.
Therefore, the established words say:
The bright way looks dim,
The advancing way looks as if retreating,
The level way looks rough,
Supreme virtue looks like a valley,
Great whiteness looks soiled,
Abundant virtue looks deficient,
Established virtue looks like cowardice,
True essence looks changeable,
The greatest square has no corners,
The greatest vessel is completed late,
The greatest music is seldom heard,
The greatest image has no shape,
The Way is hidden in namelessness.
Yet, only the Way is good in lending itself, and is complete.
