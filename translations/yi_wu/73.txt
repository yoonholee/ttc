One who shows bravery in daring will be killed.
One who shows bravery in not daring will live.
Of them both, one is beneficial and the other is harmful.
About Heaven's dislike,
Who knows the reason?
Therefore, even a sage finds it difficult.
The way of Heaven
does not compete, but is good at winning;
does not speak, but is good at responding;
does not summon, but all things come of themselves;
is broad, but is good at planning.
Heaven's net is vast;
It is loose, but never misses.
