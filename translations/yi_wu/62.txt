The Way is the refuge of all beings.
It is the good man's treasure
And the safeguard of the man who is not good.
Fine words can buy,
Respectable conduct can win people over.
If a man is not good,
How could he abandon the Way?
Therefore, if one is crowned king,
Installed by three dukes,
Although with hands full of jade,
Preceded by a four-horse team,
It is not as good as sitting here, advancing the Way.
Why, since ancient times, has the Way been thus valued?
Is it not because the one can get what he seeks
And the other can get rid of his sins?
Therefore, the Way is valued by the world.
