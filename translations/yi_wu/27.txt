Good walkers leave no track.
Good speakers leave no opening for criticism.
Good counters use no calculators.
Good closers use no bolts, but the doors cannot be opened.
Good tiers use no rope, but their knots cannot be untied.
Therefore, the sage is constantly good at saving people; no one is forsaken.
He is constantly good at saving things; nothing is abandoned.
This is called inherent enlightenment.
Therefore, good men are teachers of men who are not good;
Men who are not good are the good man's materials.
He who does not respect his teacher nor love his materials,
However intelligent, is greatly confused.
This is called essential subtlety.
