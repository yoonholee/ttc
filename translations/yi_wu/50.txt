From birth to death,
One-third are fellows of life,
One-third are fellows of death,
And one-third are fellows of life who move to grounds for death.
Why is this?
Because they are overly attached to their lives.
It is said that those who are good at sustaining life
Travel on land without meeting wild buffalos or tigers,
Enter battle without protection of armor or weapons.
In them, a wild buffalo finds no place to gore with its horns,
A tiger finds no place to seize with its claws,
A weapon finds no place to pierce with its blade.
Why is this?
Because they have no grounds for death.
