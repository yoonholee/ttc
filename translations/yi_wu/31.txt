Fine weapons are things of ill omen.
All beings may dislike them;
Therefore, one who follows the Way does not live with them.
Ordinarily, a superior man values the left side;
Using an army, he values the right side.
Weapons are things of ill omen, not a superior man's things.
He uses them only when unavoidable.
He regards contentment as best.
Even if he wins, victory is not beautiful.
To find a victory beautiful is to rejoice at killing people.
One who rejoices at killing people can never attain his will in the world.
On fortunate occasions, the left side is elevated;
On unfortunate occasions, the right side is elevated.
The lieutenant-general stays on the left;
The supreme general stays on the right.
Deal with military affairs as if they were funeral rites.
Mourn for the killing of many people.
Observe funeral rites for the winning of a war.
