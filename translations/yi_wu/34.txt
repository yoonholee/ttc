The great Way is universal,
It exists on the left and the right.
All things rely on it for life,
And it does not refuse them.
It achieves without possessing.
It clothes and feeds all things
Without being their master.
Constantly desireless, it may be called "the small".
All things return to it,
But it is not their master.
It may be called "the great".
Because it does not consider itself great,
It is able to be great.
