One who has an abundance of virtue is like a newborn baby.
Wasps and serpents do not sting it;
Fierce beasts do not seize it;
Birds of prey do not pounce on it.
Its bones are weak, its sinews are soft, but its grasp is firm.
Not yet knowing the union of female and male, its spirit is whole.
This is perfect essence.
It howls all day without getting hoarse.
This is perfect harmony.
To know harmony is to be constant;
To know constancy is to be enlightened.
To increase one's life span is ominous.
To control one's energy by mind is called strength;
To become strong is to become old.
This cannot be called the Way.
Not being in the Way, one will soon die.
