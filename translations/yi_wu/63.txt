Act through non-action,
Serve through non-doing,
Taste through non-tasting,
Do the great through the small,
Deal with the myriad through the few,
Repay malice with virtue,
Solve the difficult problem at its easiest,
Do the great work at its smallest.
The difficult affairs of the world surely start from the easy,
The great works of the world surely begin from the small.
Therefore, the sage, never doing anything for greatness,
Is able to achieve greatness.
One who promises lightly surely will not be trustworthy;
One who thinks everything easy will end in more difficulty.
Therefore, the sage, taking everything as difficult,
Will have no difficulty in the end.
