When the people no longer fear authority,
Then the great authority will come.
Do not neglect their livelihood;
Do not scorn their spiritual lives.
If you do not scorn them,
They will not reject you.
Therefore, the sage
Knows himself, but is not opinionated;
Loves himself, but is not conceited.
So, he renounces that and chooses this.
