One with supreme virtue is not attached to virtue, so has virtue.
One with lower virtue does not lose virtue, so has no virtue.
One with supreme virtue is in non-action and acts without purpose.
One with lower virtue is in action and has purpose in his actions.
One with high humanity is in action but acts without purpose.
One with high righteousness is in action and acts with purpose.
One with high propriety is in action but, if people do not respond,
He raises armies to draw others to him.
Therefore, when people lose the Way, they resort to virtue.
Losing virtue, they resort to humanity.
Losing humanity, they resort to righteousness.
Losing righteousness, they resort to propriety.
Propriety marks the lack of loyalty and trust
And the beginning of disorder!
The man with foreknowledge is only an ornament of the Way
And the beginning of stupidity.
Therefore, the great man dwells on the thick but not on the thin.
Dwells on the substance, but not on the ornament.
So, he renounces that and takes this.
