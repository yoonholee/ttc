When the great Way was abandoned,
Humanity and righteousness appeared.
When the intelligent and knowledgeable arose,
Great hypocrisy appeared.
When the six relationships were not in harmony,
Filial piety and paternalistic kindness appeared.
When the state was in chaos and disorder,
Loyal ministers appeared.
