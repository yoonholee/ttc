If the people no longer fear death,
How can one threaten them with death?
If one causes them constantly to fear death and captures and kills those who are tricky,
Who would dare to be tricky?
The one who constantly is the executioner can kill.
One who kills by taking the place of the great executioner
is like one who takes the place of the great carpenter in cutting wood.
Of those who have taken the place of the great carpenter,
Few have not hurt their own hands!
