There can be a small state with few people.
Let it have many vessels; the people will not use them.
Let the people value death and not move to far places.
Though there are boats and carriages, there is no place to ride them.
Though there are arms and weapons, there is no place to display them.
Let the people again tie knots of rope and use them.
Sweet their food,
Beautiful their clothes,
Peaceful their living,
Happy their customs.
Neighboring states can see each other,
The sounds of cocks and dogs can be heard by each other,
But the people will grow old and die, never having visited each other.
