[The ruler] not exalting talent, the people will not compete;
[The ruler] not valuing rare goods, the people will not steal;
[The ruler] not displaying desirable things, the people's hearts will not be disturbed.
Therefore, the sage's government:
empties their hearts,
fills their bellies,
weakens their wills,
strengthens their bones.
He always causes the people to have no knowledge and no desires
And causes those who are clever to not dare to act.
Acting by non-action, nothing will not be governed well.
