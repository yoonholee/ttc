Practice emptiness to its ultimate.
Maintain tranquility sincerely.
All things rise together;
I only contemplate their return.
All things flourish;
Each returns to its root.
To return to the root is tranquility;
It means to return to life.
To return to life is constancy;
To know constancy is enlightenment.
One who does not know constancy acts blindly and is in danger.
Knowing constancy, one's mind embraces all.
Embracing all, one treats all things equally.
Treating all things equally, one is kingly.
Being kingly, one is in accord with Heaven.
In accord with Heaven, one attains the Way.
Attaining the Way, one lives long.
One's entire life is without danger.
