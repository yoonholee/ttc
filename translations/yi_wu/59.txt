In governing people and serving Heaven,
There is nothing better than thrift.
Only by thrift can one submit early.
To submit early is to fully accumulate virtue.
With a full accumulation of virtue,
there is nothing that cannot be overcome.
With nothing that cannot be overcome,
one's limits are beyond knowing.
With limits beyond knowing,
one can rule a nation.
If one has the country's mother,
one can long endure.
This is called deep-root and firm-stalk.
This is the way of long life and lasting vision.
