Knowing the male and keeping to the female,
One will be the stream bed of the world.
To be the stream bed of the world,
One will not depart from the constant virtue
But will return again to infancy.
Knowing the white and keeping to the black,
One will be the pattern of the world.
To be the pattern of the world,
One will not deviate from the constant virtue
But will return to the non-ultimate.
Knowing the honor and keeping to the mean,
One will be the valley of the world.
Being the valley of the world,
One's constant virtue is complete;
One returns to simplicity.
When the uncarved block is divided, it becomes vessels.
The sage uses it to become a leader.
Therefore, the great system will not cut apart.
