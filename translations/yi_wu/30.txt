One who aids the ruler with the Way
Does not use military force to be strong in the world.
It brings retribution.
Where an army is stationed,
Briers and thorns grow.
After a great war,
A bad year invariably follows.
The good one gets a result and stops;
He dares not attribute it to his strength.
He gets results but does not brag,
gets results but does not boast,
gets results but is not arrogant,
gets results but does not make choices,
gets results but does not use force.
Anything that grows strong grows old.
This is called, "Not being with the Way".
Whatever is not with the Way will die early.
