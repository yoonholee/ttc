The Way is constantly in non-action,
But it leaves nothing undone.
If dukes and kings can keep to it,
All things will be transformed by themselves.
But, in transforming, desires arise.
I will subdue them by the nameless simplicity;
With nameless simplicity,
There will be no desires.
Being desireless is to be tranquil.
All the world will become calm by itself.
