    "HE who knows does not speak.\nHe who speaks does not know.\n\nBlock all the passages!\nShut all the doors!\nBlunt all edges!\nUntie all tangles!\nHarmonize all lights!\nUnite the world into one whole!\nThis is called the Mystical Whole,\nWhich you cannot court after nor shun,\nBenefit nor harm, honour nor humble.\n\nTherefore, it is the Highest of the world.",
    "You govern a kingdom by normal rules;\nYou fight a war by exceptional moves;\nBut you win the world by letting alone.\nHow do I know that this is so?\nBy what is within me!\n\nThe more taboos and inhibitions there are in the world,\nThe poorer the people become.\nThe sharper the weapons the people possess,\nThe greater confusion reigns in the realm.\nThe more clever and crafty the men,\nThe oftener strange things happen.\nThe more articulate the laws and ordinances,\nThe more robbers and thieves arise.\n\nTherefore, the Sage says:\nI do not make any fuss, and the people transform themselves.\nI love quietude, and the people settle down in their regular grooves.\nI do not engage myself in anything, and the people grow rich.\nI have no desires, and the people return to Simplicity.",
    "WHERE the ruler is mum, mum,\nThe people are simple and happy.\nWhere the ruler is sharp, sharp,\nThe people are wily and discontented.\n\nBad fortune is what good fortune leans on,\nGood fortune is what bad fortune hides in.\nWho knows the ultimate end of this process?\nIs there no norm of right?\nYet what is normal soon becomes abnormal,\nAnd what is auspicious soon turns ominous.\nLong indeed have the people been in a quandary.\n\nTherefore, the Sage squares without cutting, carves vfithout disfiguring, straightens without straining, enlightens without dazzling.",
    "IN governing a people and in serving Heaven,\nThere is nothing like frugality.\nTo be frugal is to return before straying.\nTo return before straying is to have a double reserve of virtue.\nTo have a double reserve of virtue is to overcome everything.\nTo overcome everything is to reach an invisible height.\nOnly he who has reached an invisible height can have a kingdom.\nOnly he who has got the Mother of a kingdom can last long.\nThis is the way to be deep-rooted and firm-planted in the Tao,\nThe secret of long life and lasting vision.",
    "RULING a big kingdom is like cooking a small fish.\nWhen a man of Tao reigns over the world, demons\nhave no spiritual powers. Not that the demons have no\nspiritual powers, but the spirits themselves do no harm\nto men. Not that the spirits do no harm to men, but the\nSage himself does no harm to his people. If only the\nruler and his people would refrain from harming each\nother, all the benefits of life would accumulate in the\nkingdom.",
    "A GREAT country is like the lowland toward which all\nstreams flow. It is the Reservoir of all under heaven,\nthe Feminine of the world. The Feminine always conquers the Masculine by her\nquietness, by lowering herself through her quietness. Hence, if a great country can lower itself before a\nsmall country, it will win over the small country; and if a\nsmall country can lower itself before a great country, it\nwill win over the great country. The one wins by\nstooping; the other, by remaining low. What a great country wants is simply to embrace\nmore people; and what a small country wants is simply\nto come to serve its patron. Thus, each gets what it\nwants. But it behooves a great country to lower itself.",
    "THE Tao is the hidden Reservoir of all things.\nA treasure to the honest, it is a safeguard to the erring.\n\nA good word will find its own market.\nA good deed may be used as a gift to another.\nThat a man is straying from the right path\nIs no reason that he should be cast away.\n\nHence, at the Enthronement of an Emperor,\nOr at the Installation of the Three Ministers,\nLet others offer their discs of jade, following it up with teams of horses;\nIt is better for you to offer the Tao without moving your feet!\n\nWhy did the ancients prize the Tao?\nIs it not because by virtue of it he who seeks finds,\nAnd the guilty are forgiven?\nThat is why it is such a treasure to the world.",
    "DO the Non-Ado.\nStrive for the effortless.\nSavour the savourless.\nExalt the low.\nMultiply the few.\nRequite injury with kindness.\n\nNip troubles in the bud.\nSow the great in the small.\n\nDifficult things of the world\nCan only be tackled when they are easy.\nBig things of the world\nCan only be achieved by attending to their small beginnings.\nThus, the Sage never has to grapple with big things,\nYet he alone is capable of achieving them!\n\nHe who promises lightly must be lacking in faith.\nHe who thinks everything easy will end by finding everything difficult.\nTherefore, the Sage, who regards everything as difficult,\nMeets with no difficulties in the end.",
    "WHAT is at rest is easy to hold.\nWhat manifests no omens is easily forestalled.\nWhat is fragile is easily shattered.\nWhat is small is easily scattered.\n\nTackle things before they have appeared.\nCultivate peace and order before confusion and disorder have set in.\n\nA tree as big as a man's embrace springs from a tiny sprout.\nA tower nine stories high begins with a heap of earth.\nA journey of a thousand leagues starts from where your feet stand.\n\nHe who fusses over anything spoils it.\nHe who grasps anything loses it.\nThe Sage fusses over nothing and therefore spoils nothing.\nHe grips at nothing and therefore loses nothing.\n\nIn handling affairs, people often spoil them just at the point of success.\nWith heedfulness in the beginning and patience at the end, nothing will be spoiled.\n\nTherefore, the Sage desires to be desireless,\nSets no value on rare goods,\nLearns to unlearn his learning,\nAnd induces the masses to return from where they have overpassed.\nHe only helps all creatures to find their own nature,\nBut does not venture to lead them by the nose.",
    "IN the old days, those who were well versed in the\npractice of the Tao did not try to enlighten the\npeople, but rather to keep them in the state of simplicity.\nFor, why are the people hard to govern? Because they\nare too clever! Therefore, he who governs his state\nwith cleverness is its malefactor; but he who governs\nhis state without resorting to cleverness is its\nbenefactor. To know these principles is to possess a\nrule and a measure. To keep the rule and the measure\nconstantly in your mind is what we call Mystical\nVirtue. Deep and far-reaching is Mystical Virtue! It\nleads all things to return, till they come back to Great\nHarmony!",
    "HOW does the sea become the king of all streams?\nBecause it lies lower than they!\nHence it is the king of all streams.\n\nTherefore, the Sage reigns over the people by humbling himself in speech;\nAnd leads the people by putting himself behind.\n\nThus it is that when a Sage stands above the people, they do not feel the heaviness of his weight;\nAnd when he stands in front of the people, they do not feel hurt.\nTherefore all the world is glad to push him forward without getting tired of him.\n\nJust because he strives with nobody,\nNobody can ever strive with him.",
    "ALL the world says that my Tao is great, but seems\nqueer, like nothing on earth. But it is just because\nmy Tao is great that it is like nothing on earth! If it were\nlike anything on earth, how small it would have been\nfrom the very beginning!\n\n I have Three Treasures, which I hold fast and watch\nover closely. The first is Mercy. The second is Frugality.\nThe third is Not Daring to Be First in the World. Because\nI am merciful, therefore I can be brave. Because I am\nfrugal, therefore I can be generous. Because I dare not\nbe first, therefore I can be the chief of all vessels.\n\n If a man wants to be brave without first being\nmerciful, generous without first being frugal, a leader\nwithout first wishing to follow, he is only courting\ndeath!\n\n Mercy alone can help you to win a war. Mercy alone\ncan help you to defend your state. For Heaven will\ncome to the rescue of the merciful, and protect him\nwith its Mercy.",
    "A GOOD soldier is never aggressive;\nA good fighter is never angry.\nThe best way of conquering an enemy\nIs to win him over by not antagonising him.\nThe best way of employing a man\nIs to serve under him.\nThis is called the virtue of non-striving!\nThis is called using the abilities of men!\nThis is called being wedded to Heaven as of old!",
    "THE strategists have a saying: I dare not be a host, but rather a guest; I dare not advance an inch, but rather retreat a foot.\n\nThis is called marching without moving,\nRolling up one's sleeves without baring one's arms,\nCapturing the enemy without confronting him,\nHolding a weapon that is invisible.\n\nThere is no greater calamity than to under-estimate the strength of your enemy.\nFor to under-estimate the strength of your enemy is to lose your treasure.\n\nTherefore, when opposing troops meet in battle, victory belongs to the grieving side.",
    "MY words are very easy to understand, and very easy to practise:\nBut the world cannot understand them, nor practise them.\n\nMy words have an Ancestor.\nMy deeds have a Lord.\nThe people have no knowledge of this.\nTherefore, they have no knowledge of me.\n\nThe fewer persons know me,\nThe nobler are they that follow me.\nTherefore, the Sage wears coarse clothes,\nWhile keeping the jade in his bosom.",
    "To realize that our knowledge is ignorance,\nThis is a noble insight.\nTo regard our ignorance as knowledge,\nThis is mental sickness.\n\nOnly when we are sick of our sickness\nShall we cease to be sick.\nThe Sage is not sick, being sick of sickness;\nThis is the secret of health.",
    "WHEN the people no longer fear your power,\nIt is a sign that a greater power is coming.\n\nInterfere not lightly vith their dwelling,\nNor lay heavy burdens upon their livelihood.\nOnly when you cease to weary them,\nThey will cease to be wearied of you.\n\nTherefore, the Sage knows himself,\nBut makes no show of himself,\nLoves himself,\nBut does not exalt himself.\nHe prefers what is within to what is without.",
    "HE who is brave in daring will be killed;\nHe who is brave in not daring will survive.\nOf these two kinds of bravery, one is beneficial, while the other proves harmful.\nSome things are detested by Heaven,\nBut who knows the reason?\nEven the Sage is baffled by such a question.\n\nIt is Heaven's Way to conquer without striving,\nTo get responses without speaking,\nTo induce the people to come without summoning,\nTo act according to plans without haste.\n\nVast is Heaven's net;\nSparse-meshed it is, and yet\nNothing can slip through it.",
    "WHEN the people are no longer afraid of death,\nWhy scare them with the spectre of death?\n\nIf you could make the people always afraid of death,\nAnd they still persisted in breaking the law,\nThen you might with reason arrest and execute them,\nAnd who would dare to break the law?\n\nIs not the Great Executor always there to kill?\nTo do the killing for the Great Executor\nIs to chop wood for a master carpenter,\nAnd you would be lucky indeed if you did not hurt your own hand!",
    "WHY are the people starving?\nBecause those above them are taxing them too heavily.\nThat is why they are starving.\n\nWhy are the people hard to manage?\nBecause those above them are fussy and have private ends to serve.\nThat is why they are hard to manage.\n\nWhy do the people make light of death?\nBecause those above them make too much of life.\nThat is why they make light of death.\n\nThe people have simply nothing to live upon!\nThey know better than to value such a life!",
    "WHEN a man is living, he is soft and supple.\nWhen he is dead, he becomes hard and rigid.\nWhen a plant is living, it is soft and tender.\nWhen it is dead, it becomes withered and dry.\n\nHence, the hard and rigid belongs to the company of the dead:\nThe soft and supple belongs to the company of the living.\n\nTherefore, a mighty army tends to fall by its own weight,\nJust as dry wood is ready for the axe.\n\nThe mighty and great will be laid low;\nThe humbie and weak will be exalted.",
    "PERHAPS the Way of Heaven may be likened to the\nstretching of a composite bow! The upper part is\ndepressed, while the lower is raised. If the bow-string is\ntoo long, it is cut short: if too short, it is added to.\n\nThe Way of Heaven diminishes the more-than-\nenough to supply the less-than-enough. The way of\nman is different: it takes from the less-than-enough to\nswell the more-than-enough. Who except a man of\nthe Tao can put his superabundant riches to the\nservice of the world?\n\nTherefore, the Sage does his work without setting\nany store by it, accomplishes his task without dwelling\nupon it. He does not want his merits to be seen.",
    "NOTHING in the world is softer and weaker than water;\nBut, for attacking the hard and strong, there is nothing like it!\n\nFor nothing can take its place.\nThat the weak overcomes the strong, and the soft overcomes the hard,\nThis is something known by all, but practised by none.\n\nTherefore, the Sage says:\nTo receive the dirt of a country is to be the lord of its soil-shrines.\nTo bear the calamities of a country is to be the prince of the world.\nIndeed, Truth sounds like its opposite!",
    "WHEN a great wound is healed,\nThere will still remain a scar.\nCan this be a desirable state of affairs?\nTherefore, the Sage, holding the left-hand tally,\nPerforms his part of the covenant,\nBut lays no claims upon others.\n\nThe virtuous attends to his duties;\nThe virtueless knows only to levy duties upon the people. The Way of Heaven has no private affections,\nBut always accords with the good.",
    "AH, for a small country with a small population!\nThough there are highly efficient mechanical\ncontrivances, the people have no use for them. Let them\nmind death and refrain from migrating to distant places.\nBoats and carriages, weapons and armour there may still\nbe, but there are no occasions for using or displaying\nthem. Let the people revert to communication by\nknotting cords. See to it that they are contented with\ntheir food, pleased with their clothing, satisfied with\ntheir houses, and inured to their simple ways of living.\nThough there may be another country in the\nneighbourhood so close that they are within sight of\neach other and the crowing of cocks and barking of dogs\nin one place can be heard in the other, yet there is no\ntraffic between them, and throughout their lives the two\npeoples have nothing to do with each other.",
    "SINCERE words are not sweet,\nSweet words are not sincere.\nGood men are not argumentative,\nThe argumentative are not good.\nThe wise are not erudite,\nThe erudite are not wise.\n\nThe Sage does not take to hoarding.\nThe more he lives for others, the fuller is his life.\nThe more he gives, the more he abounds.\n\nThe Way of Heaven is to benefit, not to harm.\nThe Way of the Sage is to do his duty, not to strive with anyone."
