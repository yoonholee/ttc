    "Act through non-action,\nServe through non-doing,\nTaste through non-tasting,\nDo the great through the small,\nDeal with the myriad through the few,\nRepay malice with virtue,\nSolve the difficult problem at its easiest,\nDo the great work at its smallest.\nThe difficult affairs of the world surely start from the easy,\nThe great works of the world surely begin from the small.\nTherefore, the sage, never doing anything for greatness,\nIs able to achieve greatness.\nOne who promises lightly surely will not be trustworthy;\nOne who thinks everything easy will end in more difficulty.\nTherefore, the sage, taking everything as difficult,\nWill have no difficulty in the end.",
    "What is at rest is easy to hold;\nWhat has not yet appeared is easy to plan.\nWhat is fragile is easy to shatter;\nWhat is small is easy to scatter.\nAct before the problem happens;\nManage before disorder arises.\nA tree as big as one's embrace springs from a tiny sprout;\nA tower with nine stories starts from a heap of earth;\nA walk of a thousand miles begins from where one stands.\nOne who acts will fail;\nOne who becomes attached will lose.\nTherefore, the sage, without acting, does not fail,\nWithout becoming attached, does not lose.\nThe people, in doing, fail at the point of success.\nOne should be as cautious at the end as at the beginning;\nThen there will be no failure.\nTherefore, the sage desires to be desireless\nAnd does not value rare treasures,\nLearns to be unlearned\nAnd reforms the faults of people.\nHe aids all things in their natural development\nAnd dares to not act on them.",
    "In ancient times, one who was good at practicing the Way\nDid not make the people clever\nBut kept them in ignorance.\nIf the people are hard to govern,\nIt is because they have too much knowledge.\nTherefore,\none who governs the state with knowledge is a malefactor to the state;\none who does not govern the state with knowledge is a benefactor to the state.\nKnowing both of these is also knowing to follow the pattern.\nConstantly knowing to follow the pattern\nIs called mystical virtue.\nMystical virtue reaches deep and far;\nIt returns with all things,\nAfter which, supreme harmony will be attained.",
    "The reason rivers and seas are able to be the kings of all valleys\nIs because they excel in taking the lowest places.\nSo, they become the kings of all valleys.\nTherefore, one who wants to be above the people\nSurely must, in words, be below them.\nOne who wants to stay before people\nSurely must, in body, stay behind them.\nTherefore, though the Sage's place is above,\nThe people are not burdened.\nThe Sage is ahead,\nBut the people are not obstructed.\nTherefore, the world happily praises and does not tire of him.\nBecause he does not compete,\nThe world cannot compete with him.",
    "All the world says that my Way is too great to be like a thing.\nIt alone is great; so, it seems like no thing.\nIf it were like a thing, it would be already small.\nI have three treasures to be kept and protected:\nThe first is called compassion;\nThe second is called thrift;\nThe third is called not daring to be ahead of the world.\nCompassionate, one can be brave;\nThrifty, one can be expansive;\nNot daring to be ahead of the world, one is able to be the leader.\nNow,\nBravery without compassion,\nExpansiveness without thrift,\nGoing ahead without retreat,\nIs fatal.\nCompassion,\nIn war, will result in victory;\nIn defense, will result in holding firm.\nWhen Heaven is going to save someone,\nIt protects him with compassion.",
    "One who excels as a knight is not warlike.\nOne who excels as a warrior is not angry.\nOne who excels at winning over enemies does not strive with them.\nOne who excels at managing people puts himself beneath them.\nThis is called the virtue of not being competitive.\nThis is called using the power of people.\nThis is called \"matching Heaven\", the ultimate state of the ancients.",
    "Military strategists have a saying,\n\"I dare not be a host; rather, a guest.\nI dare not advance an inch; rather, retreat a foot.\"\nThis can be called\nmarching without formation,\nstriving without arms,\noverthrowing without enmity,\ncapturing without weapons.\nThere is no greater calamity than to underestimate an enemy.\nTo underestimate an enemy is to lose one's treasures.\nTherefore, when opposing armies try to overcome each other,\nOne who sorrows will win.",
    "My words are very easy to understand\nand very easy to practice,\nBut the world cannot understand them\nand cannot practice them.\nMy words have their primal meaning;\nMy deeds have their principle.\nOnly I am without knowledge;\nTherefore, I am not known.\nIf those who know me are few,\nThen, what I have is of value.\nTherefore, the sage is covered by coarse clothes, but embraces jade.",
    "One who knows, but does not know, is best.\nOne who does not know, but knows, is sick.\nOnly one who recognizes this sickness as sickness\nWill not have the sickness.\nThe sage does not have this sickness\nBecause he recognizes this sickness as sickness.\nTherefore, he has no sickness.",
    "When the people no longer fear authority,\nThen the great authority will come.\nDo not neglect their livelihood;\nDo not scorn their spiritual lives.\nIf you do not scorn them,\nThey will not reject you.\nTherefore, the sage\nKnows himself, but is not opinionated;\nLoves himself, but is not conceited.\nSo, he renounces that and chooses this.",
    "One who shows bravery in daring will be killed.\nOne who shows bravery in not daring will live.\nOf them both, one is beneficial and the other is harmful.\nAbout Heaven's dislike,\nWho knows the reason?\nTherefore, even a sage finds it difficult.\nThe way of Heaven\ndoes not compete, but is good at winning;\ndoes not speak, but is good at responding;\ndoes not summon, but all things come of themselves;\nis broad, but is good at planning.\nHeaven's net is vast;\nIt is loose, but never misses.",
    "If the people no longer fear death,\nHow can one threaten them with death?\nIf one causes them constantly to fear death and captures and kills those who are tricky,\nWho would dare to be tricky?\nThe one who constantly is the executioner can kill.\nOne who kills by taking the place of the great executioner\nis like one who takes the place of the great carpenter in cutting wood.\nOf those who have taken the place of the great carpenter,\nFew have not hurt their own hands!",
    "The people are starving\nBecause those above tax them too heavily.\nTherefore, they starve.\nThe people are hard to govern\nBecause those above are too active.\nTherefore, they are hard to govern.\nThe people make light of death\nBecause those above seek too much for their own lives.\nTherefore, they make light of death.\nTo do nothing for one's life\nIs better than to value it.",
    "One who is living is soft and weak.\nOne who is dead is hard and rigid.\nAll living things, like grass and trees, are soft and frail.\nWith death, they become withered and dry.\nTherefore, hardness and rigidity are associated with death.\nSoftness and weakness are associated with life.\nTherefore, powerful weapons will not win;\nMassive trees will be cut down;\nThe strong and great will be laid low;\nThe soft and weak will be exalted.",
    "Is not the way of Heaven like the stringing of a bow?\nThe upper part is depressed,\nThe lower part is raised;\nThe too-long string is shortened,\nThe too-short string is added to.\nThe way of Heaven reduces excesses and makes-up deficiencies.\nThe path of man is not so;\nIt decreases the deficient to supply the excessive.\nWho can have more to offer to the world?\nOnly the man with the Way.\nTherefore, the sage acts without taking credit,\nAchieves without attachment.\nHe does not want to display his worthiness.",
    "Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,\nBut those who attack the hard and strong cannot conquer it,\nBecause nothing can change it.\nThe weak wins over the strong,\nThe soft wins over the tough.\nEveryone in the world knows this,\nBut no one can practice it.\nTherefore, the sage says,\nTo accept the state's sordid aspects is to be the lord of the state.\nTo accept the state's ill omens is to be the king of the world.\nTrue words sound like their opposite.",
    "Reconciliation of a great grudge\nSurely will leave some ill-will.\nHow can this be considered as good?\nTherefore, the sage holds the left-hand part of the contract and does not blame the other person.\nThe man with virtue is likely to keep the contract;\nThe man without virtue is likely to collect the tax.\nThe way of Heaven has no favor;\nIt is constantly with the good man.",
    "There can be a small state with few people.\nLet it have many vessels; the people will not use them.\nLet the people value death and not move to far places.\nThough there are boats and carriages, there is no place to ride them.\nThough there are arms and weapons, there is no place to display them.\nLet the people again tie knots of rope and use them.\nSweet their food,\nBeautiful their clothes,\nPeaceful their living,\nHappy their customs.\nNeighboring states can see each other,\nThe sounds of cocks and dogs can be heard by each other,\nBut the people will grow old and die, never having visited each other.",
    "Sincere words are not sweet;\nSweet words are not sincere.\nThe good man is not argumentative;\nThe argumentative man is not good.\nThe wise man is not erudite;\nThe erudite man is not wise.\nThe sage does not hoard.\nThe more he does for others,\nThe more he has for himself.\nThe more he gives to others,\nThe more he gains for himself.\nThe way of Heaven is to benefit others, not to harm them.\nThe way of the sage is to act, but not to compete with others."
