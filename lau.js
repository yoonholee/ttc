Does not the straightforward exist?\nThe straighforward changes again into the crafty, and the good changesagain into the monstrous.\nIndeed, it is long since the people were perplexed.\n\nTherefore the sage is square-edged but does not scrape,\nHas corners but does not jab,\nExtends himself but not at the expense of others,\nShines but does not dazzle.",
    "In ruling the people and in serving heaven it is best for a ruler tobe sparing.\nIt is because he is sparing\nThat he may be said to follow the way from the start;\nFollowing the way from the start he may be said to accumulate an abundanceof virtue;\nAccumulating an abundance of virtue there is nothing he cannot overcome;\nWhen there is nothing he cannot overcome, no one knows his limit;\nWhen no one knows his limit\nHe can possess a state;\nWhen he possesses the mother of a state\nHe can then endure.\nThis is called the way of deep roots and firm stems by which one livesto see many days.",
    "Governing a large state is like boiling a small fish.\n\nWhen the empire is ruled in accordance with the way,\nThe spirits lose their potencies.\nOr rather, it is not that they lose their potencies,\nBut that, though they have their potencies, they do not harm the people.\nIt is not only they who, having their potencies, do not harm the people,\nThe sage, also, does not harm the people.\nAs neither does any harm, each attributes the merit to the other.",
    "A large state is the lower reaches of a river:\nThe place where all the streams of the world unite.\n\nIn the union of the world,\nThe female always gets the better of the male by stillness.\n\nBeing still, she takes the lower position.\n\nHence the large state, by taking the lower position, annexes the smallstate;\nThe small state, by taking the lower position, affiliates itself tothe large state.\n\nThus the one, by taking the lower position, annexes;\nThe other, by taking the lower position, is annexed.\nAll that the large state wants is to take the other under its wing;\nAll that the small state wants is to have its services accepted bythe other.\nIf each of the two wants to find its proper place,\nIt is meet that the large should take the lower position.",
    "The way is the refuge for the myriad creatures.\nIt is that by which the good man protects,\nAnd that by which the bad is protected.\n\nBeautiful words when offered will win high rank in return;\nBeautiful deeds can raise a man above others.\n\nEven if a man is not good, why should he be abandoned?\n\nHence when the emperor is set up and the three ducal ministers are appointed,he who makes a present of the way without stirring from his seat is preferableto one who offers presents of jade disks followed by a team of four horses.\nWhy was this way valued of old?\nWas it not said that by means of it one got what one wanted and escapedthe consequences when one transgressed?\n\nTherefore it is valued by the empire.",
    "Do that which consists in taking no action;\nPursue that which is not meddlesome;\nSavor that which has no flavor.\n\nMake the small big and the few many;\nDo good to him who has done you an injury.\n\nLay plans for the accomplishment of the difficult before it becomesdifficult;\nMake something big by starting with it when small.\n\nDifficult things in the word must needs have their beginnings in theeasy;\nBig things must needs have their beginnings in the small.\n\nTherefore it is because the sage never attempts to be great that hesucceeds in becoming great.\n\nOne who makes promises rashly rarely keeps good faith;\nOne who is in the habit of considering things easy meets with frequentdifficulties.\n\nTherefore even the sage treats some things as difficult.\nThat is why in the end no difficulties can get the better of him.",
    "It is easy to maintain a situation while it is still secure;\nIt is easy to deal with a situation before symptoms develop;\nIt is easy to break a thing when it is yet brittle;\nIt is easy to dissolve a thing when it is yet minute.\n\nDeal with a thing while it is still nothing;\nKeep a thing in order before disorder sets in.\n\nA tree that can fill the span of a man's arms\nGrows from a downy tip;\nA terrace nine storeys high\nRises from hodfuls of earth;\nA journey of a thousand miles\nStarts from beneath one's feet.\n\nWhoever does anything to it will ruin it;\nWhoever lays hold of it will lose it.\n\nTherefore the sage, because he does nothing, never ruins anything;\nAnd, because he does not lay hold of anything, loses nothing.\n\nIn their enterprises the people\nAlways ruin them when on the verge of success.\nBe as careful at the end as at the beginning\nAnd there will be no ruined enterprises.\n\nTherefore the sage desires not to desire\nAnd does not value goods which are hard to come by;\nLearns to be without learning\nAnd makes good the mistakes of the multitude\nIn order to help the myriad creatures to be natural and to refrainfrom daring to act.",
    "Of old those who excelled in the pursuit of the way did not use itto enlighten the people but to hoodwink them.\nThe reason why the people are difficult to govern is that they aretoo clever.\n\nHence to rule a state by cleverness\nWill be to the detriment of the state;\nNot to rule a state by cleverness\nWill be a boon to the state.\nThese two are models.\nAlways to know the models\nIs known as mysterious virtue.\nMysterious virtue is profound and far-reaching,\nBut when things turn back it turns back with them.\n\nOnly then is complete conformity realized.",
    "The reason why the River and the Sea are able to be king of the hundredvalleys is that they excel in taking the lower position.\nHence they are able to be king of the hundred valleys.\n\nTherefore, desiring to rule over the people,\nOne must in one's words humble oneself before them;\nAnd, desiring to lead the people,\nOne must, in one's person, follow behind them.\n\nTherefore the sage takes his place over the people yet is no burden;\ntakes his place ahead of the people yet causes no obstruction.\nThat is why the empire supports him joyfully and never tires of doingso.\n\nIt is because he does not contend that no one in the empire is in aposition to contend with him.",
    "The whole world says that my way is vast and resembles nothing.\nIt is because it is vast that it resembles nothing.\nIf it resembled anything, it would, long before now, have become small.\n\nI have three treasures\nWhich I hold and cherish.\nThe first is known as compassion,\nThe second is known as frugality,\nThe third is known as not daring to take the lead in the empire;\nBeing compassionate one could afford to be courageous,\nBeing frugal one could afford to extend one's territory,\nNot daring to take the lead in the empire one could afford to be lordover the vessels.\n\nNow, to forsake compassion for courage, to forsake frugality for expansion,to forsake the rear for the lead, is sure to end in death.\n\nThrough compassion, one will triumph in attack and be impregnable indefence.\nWhat heaven succours it protects with the gift of compassion.",
    "One who excels as a warrior does not appear formidable;\nOne who excels in fighting is never roused in anger;\nOne who excels in defeating his enemy does not join issue;\nOne who excels in employing others humbles himself before them.\n\nThis is known as the virtue of non-contention;\nThis is known as making use of the efforts of others;\nThis is known as matching the sublimity of heaven.",
    "The strategists have a saying,\nI dare not play the host but play the guest,\nI dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot instead.\n\nThis is known as marching forward when there is no road,\nRolling up one's sleeves when there is no arm,\nDragging one's adversary by force when there is no adversary,\nAnd taking up arms when there are no arms.\n\nThere is no disaster greater than taking on an enemy too easily.\nSo doing nearly cost me my treasure.\nThus of two sides raising arms against each other,\nIt is the one that is sorrow-stricken that wins.",
    "My words are very easy to understand and very easy to put into practice,\nYet no one in the world can understand them or put them into practice.\n\nWords have an ancestor and affairs have a sovereign.\n\nIt is because people are ignorant that they fail to understand me.\nThose who understand me are few;\nThose who harm me are honoured.\n\nTherefore the sage, while clad in homespun, conceals on his person apriceless piece of jade.",
    "To know yet to think that one does not know is best;\nNot to know yet to think that one knows will lead to difficulty.\n\nIt is by being alive to difficulty that one can avoid it.\nThe sage meets with no difficulty.\nIt is because he is alive to it that he meets with no difficulty.",
    "When the people lack a proper sense of awe, then some awful visitationwill descend upon them.\n\nDo not constrict their living space;\nDo not press down on their means of livelihood.\nIt is because you do not press down on them that they will not wearyof the burden.\n\nHence the sage knows himself but does not display himself,\nLoves himself but does not exalt himself.\n\nTherefore he discards the one and takes the other.",
    "He who is fearless in being bold will meet with his death;\nHe who is fearless in being timid will stay alive.\nOf the two, one leads to good, the other to harm.\n\nHeaven hates what it hates,\nWho knows the reason why?\n\nTherefore even the sage treats some things as difficult.\n\nThe way of heaven\nExcels in overcoming though it does not contend,\nIn responding though it does not speak,\nIn attracting though it does not summon,\nIn laying plans though it appears slack.\n\nThe net of heaven is cast wide.\nThough the mesh is not fine, yet nothing ever slips through.",
    "When the people are not afraid of death, wherefore frighten them withdeath?\nWere the people always afraid of death, and were I able to arrest andput to death those who innovate, then who would dare?\nThere is a regular executioner whose charge it is to kill.\nTo kill on behalf of the executioner is what is described as choppingwood on behalf of the master carpenter.\nIn chopping wood on behalf of the master carpenter, there are few whoescape hurting their own hands instead.",
    "The people are hungry:\nIt is because those in authority eat up too much in taxes\nThat the people are hungry.\nThe people are difficult to govern.\nIt is because those in authority are too fond of action\nThat the people are difficult to govern.\nThe people treat death lightly:\nIt is because the people set too much store by life\nThat they treat death lightly.\n\nIt is just because one has no use for life that one is wiser than theman who values life.",
    "A man is supple and weak when living, but hard and stiff when dead.\nGrass and trees are pliant and fragile when living, but dried and shrivelledwhen dead.\nThus the hard and the strong are the comrades of death;\nThe supple and the weak are the comrades of life.\n\nTherefore a weapon that is strong will not vanquish;\nA tree that is strong will suffer the axe.\nThe strong and big takes the lower position,\nThe supple and weak takes the higher position.",
    "Is not the way of heaven like the stretching of a bow?\nThe high it presses down,\nThe low it lifts up;\nThe excessive it takes from,\nThe deficient it gives to.\n\nIt is the way of heaven to take from what has in excess in order tomake good what is deficient.\nThe way of man is otherwise: it takes from those who are in want inorder to offer this to those who already have more than enough.\nWho is there that can take what he himself has in excess and offerthis to the empire?\nOnly he who has the way.\n\nTherefore the sage benefits them yet exacts no gratitude,\nAccomplishes his task yet lays claim to no merit.\n\nIs this not because he does not wish to be considered a better man thanothers?",
    "In the world there is nothing more submissive and weak than water.\nYet for attacking that which is hard and strong nothing can surpassit.\nThis is because there is nothing that can take its place.\n\nThat the weak overcomes the strong,\nAnd the submissive overcomes the hard,\nEveryone in the world knows yet no one can put this knowledge intopractice.\n\nTherefore the sage says,\nOne who takes on himself the humiliation of the state\nIs called a ruler worthy of offering sacrifices to the gods of earthand millet.\nOne who takes on himself the calamity of the state\nIs called a king worthy of dominion over the entire empire.\n\nStraightforward words seem paradoxical.",
    "When peace is made between great enemies,\nSome enmity is bound to remain undispelled.\nHow can this be considered perfect?\n\nTherefore the sage takes the left-hand tally, but exacts no paymentfrom the people.\nThe man of virtue takes charge of the tally;\nThe man of no virtue takes charge of exaction.\n\nIt is the way of heaven to show no favoritism.\nIt is for ever on the side of the good man.",
    "Reduce the size of the population and the state.\nEnsure that even though the people have tools of war for a troop ora battalion they will not use them;\nAnd also that they will be reluctant to move to distant places becausethey look on death as no light matter.\n\nEven when they have ships and carts, they will have no use for them;\nAnd even when they have armor and weapons, they will have no occasionto make a show of them.\n\nBring it about that the people will return to the use of the knottedrope,\nWill find relish in their food\nAnd beauty in their clothes,\nWill be content in their abode\nAnd happy in the way they live.\n\nThough adjoining states are within sight of one another,\nAnd the sound of dogs barking and cocks crowing in one state can beheard in another,\nyet the people of one state will grow old and die without having hadany dealings with those of another.",
    "Truthful words are not beautiful;\nBeautiful words are not truthful.\nGood words are not persuasive;\nPersuasive words are not good.\nHe who knows has no wide learning;\nHe who has wide learning does not know.\n\nThe sage does not hoard.\nHaving bestowed all he has on others, he has yet more;\nHaving given all he has to others, he is richer still.\n\nThe way of heaven benefits and does not harm;\nThe way of the sage is bountiful and does not contend."
