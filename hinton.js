    "A Way become Way isn't the perennial Way.\nA name become name isn't the perennial name:\nthe named is mother to the ten thousand things,\nbut the unnamed is origin to all heaven and earth.\nIn perennial nonbeing you see mystery, and in perennial being you see appearance.\nThough the two are one and the same, once they arise, they differ in name.\nOne and the same they're called dark-enigma,\ndark-enigma deep within dark-enigma,\ngateway of all mystery.",

    "Never bestow honors and people won't quarrel.\nNever prize rare treasures and people won't steal.\nNever flaunt alluring things and people won't be confused.\nThis is how a sage governs.\nFill bellies and empty minds,\nstrengthen bones and weaken ambition,\nalways keep the people from knowing and wanting,\nthen those who know are those who never presume to act.\nIf you're nothing doing what you do all things will be governed well.",

    "Heaven and earth are Inhumane:\nthey use the ten thousand things like straw dogs.\nAnd the sage too is Inhumane:\nhe uses the hundred-fold people like straw dogs.\nIs all heaven and earth\nreally so much like a bellows-chamber?\nIt's empty but never contracts,\njust keeps bringing forth more and more.\nWords go on failing and failing, nothing like abiding in its midst.",
    "The valley spirit never dies.\nIt's called dark female-enigma,\nand the gateway of dark female-enigma\nis called the root of heaven and earth,\ngossamer so unceasing it seems real.\nUse it: it's effortless.",
    "Heaven goes on forever.\nEarth endures forever.\nThere's a reason heaven and earth go on enduring forever:\ntheir life isn't their own so their life goes on forever.\nHence, in putting himself last the sage puts himself first, and in giving himself up he preserves himself.\nIf you aren't free of yourself\nhow will you ever become yourself?",
    "Lofty nobility is like water.\nWater's nobility is to enrich the ten thousand things\nand yet never strive:\nit just settles through places people everywhere loathe.\nTherefore, it's nearly Way.\nDwelling's nobility is earth,\nmind's nobility is empty depth,\ngiving's nobility is Humanity,\nword's nobility is sincerity,\ngovernment's nobility is accord,\nendeavor's nobility is ability,\naction's nobility is timing.\nWhen you never strive you never go wrong.",

    "The five colors blind eyes.\nThe five tones deafen ears.\nThe five tastes blur tongues.\nFast horses and breathtaking hunts make minds wild and crazy.\nThings rare and expensive make people lose their way.\nThat's why a sage tends to the belly, not the eye, always ignores that and chooses this.",
    "Honor is a contagion deep as fear, renown a calamity profound as self.\nWhy do I call honor a contagion deep as fear?\nHonor always dwindles away, so earning it fills us with fear and losing it fills us with fear.\nAnd why do I call renown a calamity profound as self?\nWe only know calamity because we have these selves.\nIf we didn't have selves what calamity could touch us?\nWhen all beneath heaven is your self in renown you trust yourself to all beneath heaven,\nand when all beneath heaven is your self in love you dwell throughout all beneath heaven.",

    "Inhabit the furthest peripheries of emptiness and abide in the tranquil center.\nThere the ten thousand things arise, and in them I watch the return:\nall things on and ever on each returning to its root.\nReturning to the root is called tranquility,\ntranquility is called returning to the inevitable unfolding of things,\nreturning to the inevitable unfolding of things is called constancy,\nand to understand constancy is called enlightenment.\nWithout understanding constancy, you stumble deceived.\nBut understanding constancy, you're all-embracing,\nall-embracing and therefore impartial,\nimpartial and therefore imperial,\nimperial and therefore heaven,\nheaven and therefore Way,\nWay and therefore enduring:\nself gone, free of danger.",
    "The loftiest ruler is barely known among those below.\nNext comes a ruler people love and praise.\nAfter that, one they fear, and then one they despise.\nIf you don't stand sincere by your words\nhow sincere can the people be?\nTake great care over words, treasure them,\nand when the hundred-fold people see\nyour work succeed in all they do\nthey'll say it's just occurrence appearing of itself.",

    "The nature of great Integrity is to follow Way absolutely.\nBecoming things, Way appears vague and hazy.\nAll hazy and impossibly vague it harbors the mind's images.\nAll vague and impossibly hazy it harbors the world's things.\nAll hidden and impossibly dark it harbors the subtle essence,\nand being an essence so real it harbors the sincerity of facts.\nNever, not since the beginning - its renown has never been far off.\nThrough it we witness all origins.\nAnd how can we ever know the form of all origins?\nThrough this.",
    "In yielding is completion.\nIn bent is straight.\nIn hollow is full.\nIn exhaustion is renewal.\nIn little is contentment.\nIn much is confusion.\nThis is how a sage embraces primal unity as the measure of all beneath heaven.\nGive up self-reflection\nand you're soon enlightened.\nGive up self-definition\nand you're soon apparent.\nGive up self-promotion\nand you're soon proverbial.\nGive up self-esteem\nand you're soon perennial.\nSimply give up contention\nand soon nothing in all beneath heaven contends with you.\nIt was hardly empty talk\nwhen the ancients declared\nIn yielding is completion.\nOnce you perfect completion\nyou've returned home to it all.",

    "Heavy is the root of light,\nand tranquil the ruler of reckless.\nA sage traveling all day is never far from the supplies in his cart, and however spectacular the views he remains calm and composed.\nHow can a lord having ten thousand chariots act lightly in governing all beneath heaven?\nAct lightly and you lose your source-root.\nAct recklessly and you lose your rule.",
    "Perfect travels leave no tracks.\nPerfect words leave no doubts.\nPerfect accounts need no counting.\nPerfect gates close without locks and so cannot be opened.\nPerfect knots bind without rope and so cannot be loosened.\nA sage is always perfect in rescuing people and so abandons no one,\nalways perfect in rescuing things and so abandons nothing.\nThis is called the bequest of enlightenment,\nso one who possesses this perfection is a teacher of those who don't,\nand those who don't possess it are the resource of one who does.\nWithout honoring the teacher\nand loving the resource,\nno amount of wisdom can prevent vast confusion.\nThis is called the essential mystery.",
    "Knowing the masculine\nand nurturing the feminine\nyou become the river of all beneath heaven.\nRiver of all beneath heaven\nyou abide by perennial Integrity\nand so return to infancy.\nKnowing the white\nand nurturing the black\nyou become the pattern of all beneath heaven.\nPattern of all beneath heaven\nyou abide by perennial Integrity\nand so return to the boundless.\nKnowing splendor\nand nurturing ruin\nyou become the valley of all beneath heaven.\nValley of all beneath heaven\nyou rest content in perennial Integrity\nand so return to the simplicity of uncarved wood.\nWhen uncarved wood is split apart\nit becomes mere implements.\nBut when a sage is employed\nhe becomes a true minister,\nfor the great governing blade carves nothing.",
    "Longing to take hold of all beneath heaven and improve it...\nI've seen such dreams invariably fail.\nAll beneath heaven is a sacred vessel,\nsomething beyond all improvement.\nTry to improve it and you ruin it.\nTry to hold it and you lose it.\nFor things sometimes lead and sometimes follow,\nsometimes sigh and sometimes storm,\nsometimes strengthen and sometimes weaken,\nsometimes kill and sometimes die.\nAnd so the sage steers clear of extremes, clear of extravagance, clear of exaltation.",
    "If you use the Way to help a ruler of people\nyou never use weapons to coerce all beneath heaven.\nSuch things always turn against you:\nfields where soldiers camp turn to thorn and bramble, and vast armies on the march leave years of misery behind.\nThe noble prevail if they must, then stop: they never press on to coerce the world.\nPrevail, but never presume.\nPrevail, but never boast.\nPrevail, but never exult.\nPrevail, but never when there's another way.\nThis is to prevail without coercing.\nThings grown strong soon grow old.\nThis is called losing the Way: Lose the Way and you die young.",
    "Auspicious weapons are the tools of misfortune.\nThings may not all despise such tools,\nbut a master of the Way stays clear of them.\nThe noble-minded treasure the left when home and the right when taking up weapons of war.\nWeapons are tools of misfortune,\nnot tools of the noble-minded.\nWhen there's no other way,\nthey take up weapons with tranquil calm,\nfinding no glory in victory.\nTo find glory in victory is to savor killing people,\nand if you savor killing people you'll never guide all beneath heaven.\nWe honor the left in celebrations\nand honor the right in lamentations,\nso captains stand on the left\nand generals on the right.\nBut use them both as if conducting a funeral:\nwhen so many people are being killed\nit should be done with tears and mourning.\nAnd victory too should be conducted like a funeral.",
    "Way is perennially nameless,\nan uncarved simplicity.\nThough small,\nit's subject to nothing in all beneath heaven.\nBut when lords or emperors foster it,\nthe ten thousand things gladly become their guests,\nheaven mingling with earth sends down sweet dew,\nand the people free of mandates share justice among themselves.\nWhen a governing blade begins carving it up, names arise.\nOnce names arise,\nknow that it's time to stop.\nKnowing when to stop, you can avoid danger.\nWay flowing through all beneath heaven:\nit's like valley streams flowing into rivers and seas.",
    "To know people is wisdom,\nbut to know yourself is enlightenment.\nTo master people takes force,\nbut to master yourself takes strength.\nTo know contentment is wealth, and to live with strength resolve.\nTo never leave whatever you are is to abide,\nand to die without getting lost - that is to live on and on.",
    "Way is vast, a flood\nso utterly vast it's flowing everywhere.\nThe ten thousand things depend on it:\ngiving them life and never leaving them it performs wonders but remains nameless.\nFeeding and clothing the ten thousand things\nwithout ruling over them,\nperennially that free of desire,\nit's small in name.\nAnd being what the ten thousand things return to\nwithout ruling over them,\nit's vast in name.\nIt never makes itself vast and so becomes utterly vast.",

    "To gather\nyou must scatter.\nTo weaken\nyou must strengthen.\nTo abandon\nyou must foster.\nTo take\nyou must give.\nThis is called dusky enlightenment.\nSoft and weak overcome hard and strong.\nFish should be kept in their watery depths:\na nation's honed instruments of power should be kept well-hidden from the people.",
    "Way is perennially doing nothing so there's nothing it doesn't do.\nWhen lords and emperors abide by this\nthe ten thousand things follow change of themselves.\nDesire drives change,\nbut I've stilled it with uncarved nameless simplicity.\nUncarved nameless simplicity\nis the perfect absence of desire,\nand the absence of desire means repose:\nall beneath heaven at rest of itself.",

    "Return is the movement of Way, and yielding the method of Way.\nAll beneath heaven, the ten thousand things: it's all born of being, and being is born of nonbeing.",
    "When the lofty hear of Way\nthey devote themselves.\nWhen the common hear of Way\nthey wonder if it's real or not.\nAnd when the lowly hear of Way\nthey laugh out loud.\nWithout that laughter, it wouldn't be Way.\nHence the abiding proverbs:\nLuminous Way seems dark.\nAdvancing Way seems retreating.\nFormless Way seems manifold.\nHigh Integrity seems low-lying.\nGreat whiteness seems tarnished.\nAbounding Integrity seems lacking.\nAbiding Integrity seems missing.\nTrue essence seems protean.\nThe great square has no corners,\nand the great implement completes nothing.\nThe great voice sounds faint,\nand the great image has no shape.\nWay remains hidden and nameless,\nbut it alone nourishes and brings to completion.",
    "Way gave birth to one,\nand one gave birth to two.\nTwo gave birth to three,\nand three gave birth to the ten thousand things.\nThen the ten thousand things shouldered yin and embraced yang,\nblending ch'i to establish harmony.\nPeople all hate scraping by orphaned, destitute, ill-fated, but true dukes and emperors call themselves just that.\nSome things gain by loss, and some lose by gain.\nI only teach\nwhat the people teach:\nTyranny and force never come to a natural end.\nI've taken the people as my schoolmaster.",
    "The weakest in all beneath heaven gallops through the strongest, and vacant absence slips inside solid presence.\nI know by this the value of nothing's own doing.\nThe teaching without words, the value of nothing's own doing: few indeed master such things.",
    "Name or self: which is precious?\nSelf or wealth: which is treasure?\nGain or loss: which is affliction?\nIndulge love and the cost is dear.\nKeep treasures and the loss is lavish.\nKnowing contentment you avoid tarnish, and knowing when to stop you avoid danger.\nTry it and your life will last and last.",
    "Great perfection seems flawed, but its usefulness never falters.\nGreat fullness seems empty, but its usefulness never runs dry.\nGreat rectitude seems bent low,\ngreat skill seems clumsy,\ngreat eloquence seems quiet.\nBustling around may overcome cold, but tranquility overcomes heat.\nMaster lucid tranquility and you'll govern all beneath heaven.",
    "When all beneath heaven abides in Way, fast horses are kept to work the fields.\nWhen all beneath heaven forgets Way, war horses are bred among the fertility altars.\nWhat calamity is greater than no contentment, and what flaw greater than the passion for gain?\nThe contentment of fathoming contentment - there lies the contentment that endures.",
    "You can know all beneath heaven though you never step out the door,\nand you can see the Way of heaven though you never look out the window.\nThe further you explore, the less you know.\nSo it is that a sage knows by going nowhere, names by seeing nothing, perfects by doing nothing.",

    "Ancient masters of Way\nnever enlightened people.\nThey kept people simple-minded.\nIt's impossible to govern\nonce you've filled people with knowing.\nUse knowing to govern\nand you plunder the nation,\nbut use not-knowing to govern\nand you enrich the nation.\nOnce you understand this, the pattern is clear,\nand always understanding the pattern is called dark-enigma Integrity.\nDark-enigma Integrity is deep and distant, is the return of things\nback into the vast harmony.",
    "Oceans and rivers become emperors of the hundred valleys\nbecause they stay so perfectly below them.\nThis alone makes them emperors of the hundred valleys.\nSo, wanting to rule over the people a sage speaks from below them, and wanting to lead the people he follows along behind them,\nthen he can reign above without weighing the people down and stay ahead without leading the people to ruin.\nAll beneath heaven rejoices in its tireless praise of such a sage.\nAnd because he's given up contention,\nnothing in all beneath heaven contends with him.",
    "People throughout all beneath heaven say\nmy Tao is so vast it's like nothing at all.\nBut it's only vast because it's like nothing at all:\nif it were like anything else\nit would have long since become trifling.\nThere are three treasures\nI hold and nurture:\nThe first is called compassion,\nthe second economy,\nand the third never daring to lead all beneath heaven.\nCourage comes of compassion, generosity comes of economy,\nand commanding leadership comes of never daring to lead all beneath heaven.\nBut these days it's all courage without compassion, generosity without economy, and leading without following.\nThere's nothing but death in that.\nTo overcome, attack with compassion.\nTo stand firm, defend with compassion.\nWhatever heaven sustains it shelters with compassion.",
    "A noble official is never warlike,\nand a noble warrior is never angered.\nA noble conqueror never faces an enemy,\nand a noble leader stays below the people he wields.\nThis is called the Integrity of peacefulness, the power of wielding the people,\nthe fullest extent of our ancient accord with heaven.",
    "There was once a saying among those who wielded armies:\nI'd much rather be a guest than a host,\nmuch rather retreat a foot than advance an inch.\nThis is called marching without marching,\nrolling up sleeves without baring arms,\nraising swords without brandishing weapons,\nentering battle without facing an enemy.\nThere's no greater calamity than dishonoring an enemy.\nDishonor an enemy and you'll lose those treasures of mine.\nWhen armies face one another in battle,\nit's always the tender-hearted one that prevails.",
    "My words are so simple to understand\nand so easily put into practice\nthat no one in all beneath heaven understands them\nand no one puts them into practice.\nWords have their ancestral origins and actions their sovereign:\nit's only because people don't understand this that they don't understand me.\nAnd the less people understand me the more precious I become.\nSo it is that a sage wears sackcloth, keeping pure jade harbored deep.",
    "Knowing not-knowing is lofty.\nNot knowing not-knowing is affliction.\nA sage stays free of affliction.\nJust recognize it as affliction and you're free of it.",
    "When the people stop fearing the fearsome something truly fearsome will descend upon them.\nDon't hem them in\nand choke their lives with oppression.\nThat's all.\nJust let them be,\nand they'll never tire of you.\nA sage sees through himself without revealing himself,\nloves himself without exalting himself,\nalways ignores that and chooses this.",
    "To infuse daring with courage means death.\nTo infuse caution with courage means life.\nThe one enriches you, and the other ruins you.\nNo one knows why heaven\ndespises what it despises,\nthat's why a sage inhabits the complexity of things.\nThe Way of heaven never contends\nand so overcomes perfectly,\nnever speaks\nand so answers perfectly,\nnever summons\nand so arrives of itself,\nstays calm\nand so plans perfectly.\nThe net of heaven is vast, woven so vast and wide open nothing slips through.",
    "In their misery, the people no longer fear death, so how can you threaten them even with death?\nLet the people fear death always,\nthen if we seize those who follow sinister ways\nand put them to death,\nno one will dare live such lives.\nThe Executioner's killing is perennial, it's true.\nBut to undertake the killing yourself -\nthat's like trying to carve lumber for a master carpenter.\nTry to carve lumber for a master carpenter\nand you'll soon have blood on your hands.",
    "The people are starving,\nand it's only because you leaders feast on taxes\nthat they're starving.\nThe people are impossible to rule,\nand it's only because you leaders are masters of extenuation\nthat they're impossible to rule.\nThe people take death lightly,\nand it's only because you leaders crave life's lavish pleasures\nthat they take death lightly,\nthey who act without concern for life: it's a wisdom far beyond treasuring life.",
    "People are soft and weak in life,\nhard and strong in death.\nThe ten thousand plants and trees are soft and frail in life,\nwithered and brittle in death.\nThings hard and strong follow death's ways and things soft and weak follow life's:\nso it is that strong armies never overcome and strong trees always suffer the axe.\nThings great and strong dwell below.\nThings soft and weak dwell above.",
    "The Way of heaven is like a drawn bow pulling down the high and raising up the low:\nit takes away where there's abundance and restores where there's want.\nThe Way of heaven takes away where there's abundance\nand restores where there's want,\nbut the Way of humankind isn't like that:\nit takes away where there's want\nand gives where there's abundance.\nOnly a master of the Way can give abundance to all beneath heaven.\nSuch a sage acts without presumption and never dwells on success:\ngreat worth has no need to be seen.",
    "Nothing in all beneath heaven is so soft and weak as water.\nAnd yet, for conquering the hard and strong, nothing succeeds like water.\nAnd nothing can change it:\nweak overcoming strong,\nsoft overcoming hard.\nEverything throughout all beneath heaven knows this,\nand yet nothing puts it into practice.\nThat's why the sage said:\nWhoever assumes a nation's disgrace is called the sacred leader of a country,\nand whoever assumes a nation's misfortune is called the emperor of all beneath heaven.\nWords of clarity sound confused.",
    "You can resolve great rancor, but rancor always lingers on.\nUnderstanding the more noble way,\na sage holds the creditor's half of contracts\nand yet asks nothing of others.\nThose with Integrity tend to such contracts;\nthose without Integrity tend to the collection of taxes.\nThe Way of heaven is indifferent, always abiding with people of nobility.",
    "Let nations grow smaller and smaller and people fewer and fewer,\nlet weapons become rare\nand superfluous,\nlet people feel death's gravity again\nand never wander far from home.\nThen boat and carriage will sit unused\nand shield and sword lie unnoticed.\nLet people knot ropes for notation again and never need anything more,\nlet them find pleasure in their food and beauty in their clothes, peace in their homes and joy in their ancestral ways.\nThen people in neighboring nations will look across to each other,\ntheir chickens and dogs calling back and forth,\nand yet they'll grow old and die without bothering to exchange visits.",
    "Sincere words are never beautiful and beautiful words never sincere.\nThe noble are never eloquent and the eloquent never noble.\nThe knowing are never learned and the learned never knowing.\nA sage never hoards:\nthe more you do for others the more plenty is yours,\nand the more you give to others the more abundance is yours.\nThe Way of heaven is to profit without causing harm,\nand the Way of a sage to act without contending."
